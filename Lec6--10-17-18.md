<h4>Lab Hints</h4>

  * Run on seasnet servers before submitting to CCLE
  * Hawaiian words html page uses \r and \n for newlines
      - `od -c hwnwdseng.htm`  to see the ascii characters
  * Delete blank white spaces such as tab or space using
      - `tr -d '[:blank:]` 
  * use `tr -s` to squeeze multiple new lines into one
  * use `sed 's/<[^>]*>//g'` to remove all things bt angle brackets (ie html tags)

<h4>Backreferencing</h4>

  * refer to a match that was made earlier in the regex
  * ex1: replace all words in `<>` in a file, with just words
  * How:
      - `cat file | sed 's/<\([^>]*\)>/\1/g' ` 
      - or use sed with extended regular expressions

<h4><code>grep</code> matches lines</h4>

  * `echo "to be or not to be" | grep "be$"` 
      - output: `to be or not to be` 
      - the whole line, not just the part that ends in "be"
