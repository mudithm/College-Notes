<h3>Basic Structure of a Program</h3>
1. Libraries, namespace
2. Functions implememnted before main
3. declare functions inplemented after main
4. main
5. functions implemented after main


---

        #include <iostream>
        #include <string>

        using namespace std;

        int function1(){


        }

        int function2;

        int main() {


        }   

        int function2(){


        }

A getline(cin, variable) will replace a variable with an empty string if only a newline character remains in the buffer.

cin ignores leading white spaces and newline characters
it also stops when it sees a character not of the desired type or a space or new line character.

Do not use cin with strings, only use getline.

Only use cin.ignore when you use cin for an integer and then need to use getline.

If you accidentally do 
    
    if (i = 1){
        // do something
    }

it will assign 1 to i and the condition will be true, so the code within the block will execute.

The only exception to this is if you set i = 0.

    if (1 == i){
        //This is preferred over (i == 1)
    }

---

    do {
        i++;
    }while(meme == true)

do while loops check the condition after the block executes. P much the same otherwise.
