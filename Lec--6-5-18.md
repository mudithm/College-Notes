_Politics in Europe after the Reformation: France and England_

---

> Constitutionalism and Absolutism

<h4>Recap</h4>

  * Reformation: religious movement with political consequences
  * Christianity breaks up
      - no longer the binding factor Western Europe
  * Cuius regio, eius religio

<h3>French wars of Religion</h3>

  * Protestant minority under Catholic monarchy, leads to a civil war
  * Centralized tradition prevents what happened in Germany to reoccur
      - No federal states to split
  * Ingredients for a bloodshed:
      - Big country, stronf trad of natl identity
      - strong Calvinist minority, called Huguenots
      - A young king and a strong, Machiavellion queen, Catherine de Medici
      - Charismatic Huguenot leader, Henry of Navarre

<h4>Steps of the War</h4>

  * Catherine tries to play the Huguenots (navarre) and the Catholics (the league) against each other
  * 1572: marriage bt Marguerite de Medici and Henry of Navarre
  * Night before marriage: St Bartholomew's day Massacre
      - Queen and Catholic League try to kill all Huguenots. Henry barely escapes
  * 1570's and 1580's: the ware of the 3 Henrys: Henry III, king, Henry of Guise, Catholic league, and Henry of Navarre, Huguenot

<h4>Political consequences</h4>

  * Reformation cannot be "fixed" like the German wat (cannot divide France into states)
  * Two solutions were developed:
      - Limit the authority of the Sovereign, so the she/he cannot  kill subjects for any reason, even religion, OR
      - Increase the authority of the sovereign, so that he/she is ABOVE the religious factions

<h4>End of the wars of religion</h4>

  * Henry wins the war
  * Henry of Navarre becomes the first Protestant king of France
  * Henry converts to Catholicism, but:
      - Issues the Edict of Nantes, and grante the Huguenots freedom of worship
  * BUT:
      - Henry is killed by a religious fanatic and French crown recovers by strengthening its absolutist character
