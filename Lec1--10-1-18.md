<h4>Year Overview</h4>

  * Presentations at the end of the Year
  * Look at the website

<h4>What is open source software?</h4>

  * Source code is public
  * anyone can modify it, as long as they don't use it commercially
  * Eg:
      - Firefox
      - Android
      - Apache

<h4>GNU/Linux</h4>

  * Open Source OS
      - <b>Kernel:</b> core of os
      - allocates time and memory to programs
      - handles direct hardware interfacing
      - handles file system and comms between software and hardware
      - <b>Shell:</b> interface bt user and kernel
      - interprets user commands and takes necessary action to execute them
      - <b>Programs</b>

<h4>Command Line Interface vs Graphical User Interface</h4>

| CLI | GUI | 
| --- | --- |
| Steep Learning Curve | Intuitive | 
| Pure Control | Limited Control | 


---

<h4>The Basics: Shell</h4>

  * `up arrow` previous command
  * `tab` auto-complete
  * `!!` replace with previous command

<h5>Files and Processes</h5>

   * Everything is a Process or a File
       - <b>Process:</b> executing program identified by PID
       - <b>File:</b> Collection of data. All these are implemented in linux as files
           + document
           + text of program
           + executable
               * binaries, etc
           + directory
           + devices

<h5>File system Layout</h5>

  * Tree structured hierarchy

<h5>Moving Around</h5>

  * `pwd <path (optional)>`: print working directory
  * `cd <path (optional)>`: change directory
      - `~`: home dir
      - `.`: current dir
      - `/`: root directory
      - `..`: parent directory
  * Relative vs Absolute pathing
      - default path for cd is at the current directory
      - `~` is the home
          + important especially for SEASNET server use
      - `/` is the root
          + used for absolute

<h5>File commands</h5>

  * `mv <path-to-file> <path-to-destination>`: move/rename a file
      - works like a "cut/paste" in windows
  * `cp <path-to-file> <path-to-destination>`: copy file
      - works like a "copy/paste" in windows
  * `rm <path-to-file>`: remove file
      - `-r`: flag to recursively remove directory contents
  * `mkdir <dir name>`: make a dir
  * `rmdir <dir name>`: remove a dir (empty)
  * `ls`: show contents of dir
      - `-a`: flag to show hidden files as well
      - `-l`: flag to show more details, and permission
      - `-d`: flag to list directories
  * `touch <filename>`: make a new file
      - in Linux, file extension generally doesn't matter--whatever program you choose to open it with will interpret its data as it is programmed to

---

<h4>Linux file permissions</h4>

  * `chmod <who> <symbol> <permission> <path to file>`: assigns permissions for file (access control metrics)
      - `r`: read permission
      - `w`: write permission
      - `x`: execute permission
      - Control who has this access:
          + `u`: user (owner of the file)
          + `g`: group (members of an associated group)
          + `o`: others 
          + `a`: all of the above, same as `ugo`
      - Add, remove, or whatever
          + `+`: add permission
          + `-`: remove permission
          + `=`: make the specified modes the exact modes for the people it is applied to
  * Examples:
      - `chmod u+rwx ~/assignment/script.sh` gives the user read, write, and execute permissions 
      - `chmod ug=rw ~/assignment/script.sh` sets the permissions for the user and group to exactly read and write. If the user previously had execute permissions, they would lose them
  * Check out the more simple Octal notation [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/518259/understanding-chmod-symbolic-notation-and-use-of-octal)
  * The codes for the octal notation are as follow:

  * The command structure works like this: 
      - `chmod <user><group><other> <path-to-file>`
      - ex: `chmod 777 ~/assignment/script.sh` is equivalent to `chmod ugo=rwx`
