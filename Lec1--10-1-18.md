_Introduction to Digital Systems_

---

<h4>What is digital?</h4>
  
  * __Digital Systems:__ inputs and outputs from a finite number of discrete values
  * __Analog Systems:__ inputs and outputs from a continuous infinite set
  * Main uses of Digital Systems:
      - Information Processing (text, audio, visual, video)
      - Transmission
      - Numerical and non numerical information processing

<h4>Why digital?</h4>

  * Insensitive to variations of component parameter values (small variations in analog signals)
  * can be made more accurate by increasing the number of digits used to represent data

<h4>Classes of Digital Systems</h4>

  * Combinational Systems:
      - no memory, output doesn't depend on previous input
  * Sequential systems
      - depends on previous input
