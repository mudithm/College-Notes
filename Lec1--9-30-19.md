<h5>Background</h5>

  * D. E. Knuth -- The Art of Computer Programming
      - 1st edition vol 1. Addison-Wesley
      - math + software + English text
  * He was going to design a language for writing books
  * And then a program to translate this language into a camera-ready copy of the book
  * This language is called TEX (ie LaTEX)
      - Written in PASCAL
      - Web browsers routinely use some of Knuth's techniques to make stuff look better
  * Wrote the TEXBOOK to describe it
      - written in TEX
  * But, since he had to both update the pascal code and the book that analyzed it, in order to avoid syncing issues, he developed "literate programming"
      - Think of it as a pascal program with "comments" in it, that are actually TEX directives
      - He created a translator to change the pascal code to TEX, and another to reorder the programs to ensure that all functions were declared before they were used
      - Wrote a paper to sort cocordance using hash tries & simultaneously introduced & explained literate programming

Code from problem: 
```sh
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n]*' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr 

```

`tr -cs`: complement, suppress duplicate newlines
`univ -c`: count
`sort -nr`: numeric, reverse order

Choice of notation matters; although Knuth's solution is much more efficient, based on the problem & how often it is needed, a scripting solution might be better

<h5>Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis</h5>

1. The structural diversity of (natural) languages is essentially limitless
2. The language we use, to some extent, ~~determines~~ affects how we view the world, and how we think

<h5>Language Design Principles</h5>

  * Orthogonality
      - A choice in one attribute should not affect other attributes
      - Non-orthogonality:
          + In C, functions can return any values _except_ arrays.
              * if you decide that a function can return something, you decide that it cannot return an array
          + It complicates the language
  * Efficiency (Time, space, power, network access, etc)
  * Simplicity
      - might sacrifice convenience, familiarity
  * Convenience
  * Familiarity
  * Safety
      - classic example: out of bounds arrays
      - c example:
          + `char c; int *p = &c; *p = 10000;` 
              * Compiler will catch this
      - No checking vs Runtime Checking vs Compile-Time Checking
  * Mutability
