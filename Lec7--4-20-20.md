<h3>Thomas Kuhn (1922 - 1996)</h3>

  * Started as a physicist, switched to history and Philosophy of Science
  * Best known work is **The Structure of Scientific Revolutions** from 1962
  * Idiosyncracies of various scientists

<h3>The notion of a "paradigm"</h3>

  * Examples
      - The caloric paradigm
      - the phlogiston paradigm
      - Newton's paradigm
  * Further specification of the idea
      - Paradigms are ways of seeing the world
      - Paradigms are illustrative examples
      - Paradigms include views about how science should be done
      - Paradigms include grand metaphysical principles
          + investigation of things lying beyond the senses
          + determinism
      - Paradigms include agreed upon standards for evaluating scientific hypotheses
  * Different paradigms are incommensurable
      - they are not comparable by any neutral standard
      - a paradigm includes its own standards of evaluation
          + Type of argumentation that is required (whether it ought to appeal to experiment or to reason)
          + the types of things that need to be explained
          + The types of explanations that count
          + the sorts of claims that count as simple
  * People in different paradigms are not fully able to communicate with each other since they use key terms in different wyas or they use completely different terms
      - eg Newton and Einstein both used 'mass', but they made different claims about it
          + Newton thougt that the mass of an atom is constant regardless of its state of motion
          + Einstein thought that the mass of an atom would increase as its velocity increases
              * Is this a substantive difference, or are they referring to different things for "mass"?


<h3>Decarte's Paradigm vs Newton's Paradigm</h3>

  * Surrounding the sun is a giant whirlpool, and the planets are being pushed in the same direction because of this whirlpool
      - vortex theory
  * Decartes thinks that interactions between bodies at a distance aren't explainable
      - I can't move something from a distance, so neither can the Sun
  * So, he would disagree with the theory of Gravity, because that operates in a paradigm that allows for interactions between bodies at a distance

<h3>Periods within Scientific Development</h3>

  * Pre-science
  * Normal Science
      - anomalies arise
  * Crisis Period
  * Revolution

<h3>Normal Science</h3>

  * A single paradigm dominates
      - anyone who studies/believes in a different paradigm, they might not be taken seriously
  * The dominant paradigm is not questioned, only further honed
      - working within the paradigm, doing "puzzle-solving"
      - ie finding a more precise value for the mass of Mars
  * Popper might think that scientists should be trying to contradict the dominant paradigm all the time
  * Kuhn would disagree

<h3>Prescriptive vs Descriptive</h3>

  * People often don't use their turn signals when turning
      - Descriptive
  * People should use their turn signals when turning
      - Prescriptive/normative 
  * Descriptive phil of science would only try to describe how science actually works
  * Prescriptive phil of science is trying to say how it should work
  * Kuhn tends to stay more towards the Descriptive side, but maybe does push a Perscriptive view, that these dominant periods should exist, to create more progress

<h3>Anomalies</h3>

  * some phenomenon that seems to deny/contradict the paradigm
  * IE in phlogiston theory: some metals become heavier after they burn
  * in Newton's theory
      - Advance of the perihelion of Mercury (noticed in 1859)
      - mercury's orbit is a "rotating" ellipse

<h3>Pre-science</h3>

  * When there *is* no dominant paradigm
