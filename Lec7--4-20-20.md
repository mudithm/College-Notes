<h3>Pseudo-random generator</h3>

  * PRG(seed) &rarr; Output
      - |Output| >> |seed|
  * Next-bit test: no PPT adv can predict next bit of prg output with prob > 1/2 + &epsilon;
  * Computational indist
      - no ppt J can distinguish output of PRG from Random with prob > 1/2 + &epsilon;

<h3>Proof</h3>

  * Contrapositive
  * comp ind &rArr; next bit test
      - &exist; next bit &rArr; &exist; distinguishisher J
      - trivial: if next bit test works, then it can be used by the judge to predict with prob &gt; 1/2 + &epsilon;
  * next bit test &rArr; comp ind
      - &exist; comp indist &rArr; &exist; next bit test
      - __F7.1__

<h3>PRG Construction</h3>

  * __F7.2__
  * THM: if 1-way permutations exist, then the PRG passes all next bit tests
  * PF, contrapositive
  * __F7.3__
      - By hardcore predicate, if we can output dot prod of &lt;r, z&gt; with prob greater than 1/2. , when we can invert the funct
