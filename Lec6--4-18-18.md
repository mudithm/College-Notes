  * Statically sized, nested arrays 
      - compiler knows dimensions at compile time
      - can perform optimizations incl strength red rather than multiplication
  * Dynamically sized, nested array
      - dimensions unknown at compile time
      - must use mult instead of strength red, etc.
      - Sometimes requires two "loads" (usually just once)
  * Statically sized, multilevel array
      - requires two "loads", which means two fetches from memory.
      - slower usually than the other two options
      - other two have 1 load


Pre-processor directive: `#define`, etc. `define` replaces all instances of whatever variable follows it with the value specified before compilation occurs.

Allocating memory for a dynamically allocated array (of longs):

```c
    blue = (long *)calloc(n*n, sizeOf(long)); //Simulated 2D array w/in a 1D
```

Accessing mem for static:

```c
array[i][j];
```

For Dynamic:

```c
array[i * n + j];
```

Multilevel Dynamic:
```c
array[i][j];
```
