<h3>Strong signature</h3>

  * Cannot come up with a different signature of the same document, after seeing one signed version.
  * In the OG signature, the adversary has to generate a forgery of a *new* document
  * In the strong signature def, they can do this *or* generate a forgery of a document it has already seen.

<h3>Lamport 1-time signature scheme</h3> 

  * __10.1__
  * will sign at most m bits in life
      - the length of all the documents you will ever sign put together
  * Take f, one way function from n &rarr; m bits
  * pick x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, ... x<sub>2m</sub>, each of length n (randomly)
  * Compute 
      - f(x<sub>1</sub>) = y<sub>1</sub>
      - f(x<sub>2</sub>) = y<sub>2</sub>
      - ...
      - f(x<sub>2m</sub>) = y<sub>2m</sub>
  * k = n
  * Proof of security __10.2__
