<h3>Imre Lakatos (1922 - 1974)</h3>

  * Inspired by Popper and claimed that many of his views were implicit in Popper
  * He thought that Kuhn's views suggested that science was merely a matter of "mob psychology"
  * Rather than "paradigms", he spoke of "scientific research programs"
      - used the word "paradigm" as one would use "theory"

<h3>Two parts to a scientific research program</h3> 

  * A "hard core" that represents the main elements of the program
  * A "protective belt" that is used to apply the hard core to particular cases

<h3>Lakatos gave the following "methodological principles"</h3>

  * Within a scientific research program, changes should only be made to the protective belt
  * Changes to the protective belt should be "progressive" in the sense that they extend the domain of the research program

<h3>Evaluating progressive research programs</h3> 

  * One can evaluate research programs according to whether they are "progressing" (being extended to new research) or "degenerating" (failing to be extended or even having to retreat from an area they once claimed to handle).
  * Lakatos does not say that scientists ought to work on the most progressive research program. rather, he thinks that it is rational to protect a degenerating program for a while in case it is only having a temporary setback
  * Feyerabend pointed out that this does not give us precise rational criteria to use to select the best research program

<h3>Laurence Laudan (1941-)</h3>

  * He refers to "scientific research traditions"
  * His notion allows that things can be added to or subtracted from the hard core without that constituting a new tradition
  * "Pursuing" vs "Accepting" a tradition
      - Accepting a tradition is believing that it is likely true
      - Pursuing a tradition involves working on the tradition so as to improve it
      - Laudan thought that it would sometimes be rational to pursue a theory that it would not be rational to accept
          + Suppose there is a lottery, for $1, w/ 10k total tickets (1 each)
              * It is rational to pursue the lottery, but not rational to expect to win the lottery
      - Scientists would be rational to accept the research tradition having the "highest level of problem solving power"
      - Scientists would be rational to pursue the tradition having the highest rate of progress when it comes to problem solving
