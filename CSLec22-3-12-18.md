Hash Tables: Have constant or linear times, but when iterating through it is difficult to go in the correct order.

Trees: Slower than a hash table in most cases (even if well balanced) but ordered correctly

<h4>Ways to keep an ordered tree</h4>

  * AVL tree
      - Keep track of the number of subtrees. Should be within 1 of eachother
      - Each node has another data member that keeps track of if the left subtree is equal to, one less than, or one greater than the right side, and addition etc is done taking this into account.
      - When adding or deleting, trees must be rebalanced
      - Fairly tedious, but can be worth it. Guarantees logN worst-case behavior
  * 2-3 tree
  

<h4>BST types</h4>
  
  * Set
  * Map
  * multiset
  * multimap

<h4>Hash types</h4>
  
  * unordered_set
  * unordered_map
  * unordered_multiset
  * unordered_multimap

```c++
map<string, double> ious;

string name;
double amt;

while (cin >> name >> amt)
    ious[name] += amt; // the map [] operator takes a key type and
                       // returns a reference tp the value

// lists the summary of the map
for (map<string, double>::iterator it = ious.begin(); it != ious.end(); it++)
{
    cout << p->first << " owes me $" << p->second << endl; 
}

if (ious.find("Ricky") != ious.end())
    cout << "Ricky owes me money."

cout << ious.size() << " people owe me money."<<endl;

```

To convert this entire code into a hash table, we just need to change the first line to `unordered_map<string, double> ious;`

You would do this if you don't care about the order of the items.

If you want to do this with non built-in types, you must define a `<` operator for a map, and for an unordered_map, your object must be hashable and must have a defined `==` operator.

__Priority Queue:__ a BST data structure ordered by priority

__Complete Binary Tree:__ a binary tree that is full at every level except possibly the bottom, which is filled left to right.

__Max heap:__a complete binary tree where each node has a value >= all the nodes in its subtrees

__Min heap:__a complete binary tree where each node has a value <= all the nodes in its subtrees
