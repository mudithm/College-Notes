<h1>Evolution</h1>

  * Specific to biology
  * process by which organisms change with time such that descendants differ progressively more from their ancestor.
  * Evolution is possible because the genetic code, while remarkably error-correcting, is not error-free.

<h5>Evolution after Darwin</h5>

  * There is little dispute that evolution is Darwinian in how it operates
  * organisms more suited to survive in their given ecosystems are more likely to survive and reproduce.

---

<h5>How natural selection works</h5> 

1. Genetic Diversity
  * members of a population are not exactly alike
  * some genetic diversity.
2. Natural selection
  * Some traits are better to have than others
  * More of the benefited organisms survive to reproduce
3. Time
  * The rate of mutation is relatively slow, so it takes a very long time for these changes to manifest themselves.

<h5>Passing genes to the next generations</h5>

  * Cell Division
  * Lateral Gene Transfer
      - conducted by Plasmids that contain some genetic information that can be exchanged between microbial cells through the pilus
  * Sexual Reproduction
      - Some genetic information from each of the parents

<h5>How does mutation happen?</h5>

1. DNA fails to copy accurately
2. External influences
  * Exposure to specific chemicals or radiation (UV light, radioactive substances)
  * Can break down DNA
  * When the cell tries to repair the DNA, it might not be able to repair perfectly, causing a mutation to form.

<h5>Problems of the first cell: Osmotic Stress</h5>

Water moves readily across cell membranes through protein lined channels, and if the total concentration of all dissolved solutes is not equal on both sides, there will be net movement of water molecules into or out of the cell.

1. In a hypotonic solution (higher salt concentration inside), water comes into the cell, and causes it to become lysed.
2. In an isotonic solution, there is the same concentration of solute both inside and outside, it is in an equilibrium.
3. In a hypertonic solution (higher salt concentration outside) the cell can shrivel because the water tries to exit the cells.

<h6>Evolutionary solution: ATP driven pumps for ions</h6>

{{look at the pretty picture}}

Moving something against the diffusion gradient requires energy, so these pumps require energy.

<h6>Next problem: Phospholipid bilayer only permeable for lipid-soluble nutrients</h6>

**Solution:** Transfer mechanism for water soluble nutrients.
  * channel mediated diffusion or carrier mediated diffusion.

_Over time, cell membranes developed more and more functional proteins. Some of these could detect light, others did other things._

<h5>Origin of Eukaryotes</h5>

It took about 1.2 billion years after the first prokaryotes appeared for the first eukaryotes to appear.

<h6>The key innovation in the origin of the Eukaryotic cells: Organelles</h6>

The two most important:

1. Chloroplasts
  * Perform photosynthesis
2. Mitochondria
  * Help perform respiration 

<h6>Endosymbiotic theory</h6>

_it is theorized that organelles like mitochondria and chloroplast were originally prokaryotes that were engulfed by archaea_

<h6>Mitochondria</h6>

_The key to multicellular animals_

  * 18 fold increase in production of ATP from ADP associated with mitochondrial respiration relative to prokaryotic fermentation

The mitochondrial genome is extremely reduced, which means that it is now completely dependent on the cell it is inside.

<h5>Three theories of the development of multicellular life</h5>

1. Formation of a grex (or slug) from a single amoeba
2. Formation of Syncytium (cell with many nuclei) by incomplete cell division followed by membrane formation and cell speciation.
3. A unicellular organism decided, and the daughter cells failed to separate, thereby resulting in a conglomeration of identical cells in one organism which could each then specialize.

<h5>Triggers initiating or enhancing evolution</h5>

  * Mutation through UV light
  * Spatial Isolation
  * Climate Change
  * Mass extinction events


 <h6>Isolation can lead to the development of new species</h6> 

 [Berkeley's Evolution Website](http://evolution.berkeley.edu)

  * Example: Madagascar's Unique animals
  * Separated circa 88 Myr ago
  * 90% of the wildlife is endemic, which means it can only be found there

 <h6>Climate Change</h6>

   * Last ice age 18000 years ago.
   * The landscape was very different
   * Dire wolves, Mammoths, giant deers and elk, etcetera. All were very large because there were no forests, so they could be very large.

<h6>Mass extinction events</h6>

  * Probably the first catastrophe: rise of oxygen
      - organisms that could not deal with oxidation were restricted to oxygen less environments
      - aerobic respiration became pop at this time.
  * Provide empty ecosystems for new lifeforms to occupy by wiping out large fractions of the previous inhabitants of those ecosystems.
      - EG Mammals took over after the extinction of the Dinosaurs

<h6>Did a meteoroid extinct the dinosaurs?</h6>

Indications:
  * 15% of shallow water species were extinct
  * iridium was more prevalent, and it is much more common in meteoroids (100x)

Consequences:
  * Hitting water causes tsunamis and adds water vapor
  * Hitting ground causes the sky to darken with debris

After the Dinos disappeared, mammals became the dominating species p fast.
Birdos are descendants of dinosaurs
