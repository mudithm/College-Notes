<h3>Venn Diagram of Languages</h3>

  * __13.1__
  * universal set is the Power Set of &Sigma;<sup>&ast;</sup> (2<sup>&Sigma;<sup>&ast;</sup></sup>)
  * CFL's are languages that are recognizable by a PDA
  * FSL's are a proper subset of CFLS, as are Inherently Ambiguous CFLs
      - These two subsets do not overlap
  * FSL's are also a proper subset of the Deterministic CFL's, which are also a proper subset of CFL's
  * This is me typing. The only thing stopping me from becoming the thing whose things are among the most memelike of all the things
  * If for every single state, if there is at most one choice, that is a deterministic machine

<h3>Formal Definition of Deterministic PDA</h3>

![Formal definition of Deterministic PDA](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/581226308672159747/709910243194306651/unknown.png) 

  * For any combination of a state and an input/top of stack, *exactly* one of the &delta; functions described by the blue text above is taken
  * Pictorial representation: __F13.2__

| Input symbol | Stack Symbol | Constraint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Real a | Real x | You cannot have two branches with the same explicit input symbol a and stack symbol x (also, cannot have any other branches that ignore either the input a or the top of the stack x) |
| Real a | &epsilon; | If P can ignore the stack, then that is the only move for that symbol a. |
| &epsilon; | Real x | If P can ignore the input, then that is the only move on top of the stack x |
| &epsilon; | &epsilon; | If you can ignore *both* the input and the top of the stack, that is the *only* move that can be taken. |

>Only one of each case can be &ne; &empty; (All others must block)

<h3>Example</h3>

  * L = {balanced ()'s} &epsilon;, (), (()), (())()(()())
  * 1st attempt at DPDA:
      - accept &epsilon;
      - Read (, push (
      - Read ) with top = (, pop (.
      - Accept whenever the stack is empty
      - __F13.3__
      - This rejects any input that begins with a right parenthesis
  * This is not a DPDA, because the second state has a transition on input &epsilon; and also on stack symbol &epsilon;
      - Reminder: transition with an &epsilon; in the input and an &epsilon; in the stack symbol always conflict
      - Transitions with *both* conflict with any other transition
  * Second attempt:
  * __F13.4__
  * This *is* deterministic, because no state has more than one transition on an &epsilon;, and none of the real symbol transitions conflict.

<h3>Midterm Problems</h3>

  * There will be a question on the application of the CFL Pumping Lemma
  * There will be a question involving the construction of a PDA
      - no requirement for determinism
  * Another question on CFL's
  * Question on explaining some languages, in English, like the problems on the sample midterm.
