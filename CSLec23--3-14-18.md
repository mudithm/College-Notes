<h1>Lecture 23 (Final Lecture)</h1>

Remember, a __complete binary tree__ is a binary tree that is full at every level except perhaps the bottom, which is filled from left to right.

A __max heap__ is a complete binary tree where each node has a value >= all the nodes in its subtrees.

A __min heap__ is a complete binary tree where each node has a value <= all the nodes in its subtrees.

Heap operations guidelines: first make it a complete binary tree, then fix it (remake the heap)

insert: Add to tree, bubble up to proper position
remove highest (lowest for minheap) priority item): frst make it a complete binary tree, then trickle it down to proper position (promote the bottom rightmost item to the root & then swap w biggest child (if smaller))

Another representation of a binary tree:

<h4>Array form of a complete binary tree.</h4>

  * Root: index 0
  * Left subtree: index 2i + 1
  * Right subtree: index 2i + 2
  * Remove node
      - Promote bottom rightmost to node pos:
      - move item at i = n-1 to pos of node
      - compare with children (2i+1 & 2i+2) and swap if necessary
          + or (2i + 2 - i%2) 
  * insertion
      - insert at end of array
      - swap w parent nodes as necessary
          + parent is (i+i%2-2)/2
  * heapsort: inserting items into a heap puts them in order
      - heapsort takes this heap and goes from left to right.
      - Steps:
          + Make it a heap, working from the bottom up
          + Repeatedly:
              * Take root and swap w bottom right
              * Make it a heap (trickle root down following pattern)
              * move "barrier" one to the left 
      - Speed is comparable to fast sorts, its words case is Nlog(N), but with a higher constant of proportionality than quicksort

<h4>Another data structure: Graph</h4>

  * Directed acyclic graph:
      - no loops, etc.
