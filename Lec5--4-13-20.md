<h3>Sir Karl Popper</h3>

  * One goal is to solve the "demarcation problem" -- What is the difference between science and pseudo science?
  * Another goal is to say how science works given that it must avoid induction. Induction is irrational.
      - Differs from Log Pos's -- they talked about meaningful/meaningless, Popper thought about scientific/unscientific
  * Examples of what he thought were pseudo-sciences:
      - Freudian psychology and the theory of the oedipal complex
      - Adler's theory of the inferiority complex

<h3>What counts as a scientific hypothesis?</h3>

  * A hypothesis is scientific if and only if it has the possibility of being refuted (falsified) by some possible observation
  * Both the Freudians oedipal complex, and the inferiority complex do not fit this claim
      - both if someone does or doesn't do something, an argument can be made that they were caused by a complex in either case
  * Scientific theory, on the other hand, make exact predictions that can be refuted

<h3>Why emphasize falsification rather than verification?</h3>

  * Most scientific claims are generalizations
  * Verifying a generalization requires induction
  * Falsifying one requires only deduction
      - If all emeralds are green then emerald E1 is green.
      - Emerald E1 is not green
      - ---
      - Not all emeralds are green
          + this is a modus tollens arg

<h3>What is the method of science?</h3>

  * One makes a conjecture and attempts to refute it.
  * The bolder one's conjecture, the better
      - This makes it much easier to falsify
  * If the theory is not refuted by the experiment, one cannot conclude that it is true
      - one only knows it has not yet been shown to be false
  * If it is refuted, one comes up with a new conjecture and starts again

<h3>the Quine-Duhem Problem (Holism about testability)</h3>

  * Individual statements do not imply things that can be checked by observation
  * Example:
      - F = ma
      - F<sub>g</sub>=-Gm<sub>1</sub>m<sub>2</sub>/r<sup>2</sup>
      - The mass of the sun = x
      - The mass of Venus = y, etc.
      - The position of the Sun is q, etc.
  * Individual statements don't have implications that can be checked; we need a large body of statements to make meaningful observations
      - If (P & Q & R) then O
      - Not O.
      - ---
      - Not (P & Q & R)
      - But which one is false?
          + Modus Tollens does not tell us this
          + so, are scientific statements falsifiable?s

<h3>Quantum Mechanics</h3>

  * Largely agreed upon that Quantum Mechanics only gives probabilistic predictions
  * Any observation then fits with the theory, it cannot necessarily ever be disproven
      - Popper might have to say that Quantum Mechanics is a pseudo-science
      - So, perhaps, his solution to the problem of demarcation is insufficient
