<h3>Explanation</h3>

  * We wondered whether science correctly describes things, but one can also wonder whether it explains them
  * In the 19th century, many scientists were attracted to the view that it only describes things. The thought was that Newton described how the planets move, but did not explain why they move that way
  * One reason some felt this way was that they became skeptical about the notion of causation
      - If to explain something is to say what causes it and if there is no causation, then there is no explanation

<h3>What is it to explain something?</h3> 

  * One idea is that we want unfamiliar things to be explained, and what explanations do is show us that the unfamiliar thing is accounted for by something familiar
  * this does not strike many as right due to examples like "Olber's Paradox"
  * Useful Vocab:
      - Explanandum: the thing to be explained
      - Explanans: the fact (or facts) that does the explaining
      - The Explanans explains the Explanandum

<h3>The Deductive-Nomological (or Covering-Law) Model of Explanation</h3>

  * Due to Hempel and Oppenheim
  * An explanation is a deductive argument with the Explanans as the premise (or premises) and the Explanandum as conclusion
  * The Explanans must contain at least one general law of nature and that law must be required in the argument
  * The Explanans must be true
  * The Explanans must be "empirical content"
  * Perhaps a 5th condition should be added:
      - The explanans must include the cause of the explanandum

<h3>Example -- Deductive-Nomological Model of Exp.</h3>

  * The height of tower is H
  * Light goes in straight lines
  * the position of the sun is P
  * -----
  * the length of the shadow is S.
  * This is flawed, since switching the first premise and the conclusion provides a valid D-N model, but not a valid argument. (the length of the shadow does not cause the height of the tower)
  * Perhaps a 5th condition should be added:
      - The explanans must include the cause of the explanandum
