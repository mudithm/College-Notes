<h3>Operating Systems</h3>

> "We don't offer a ready-made programme, but an entire operating system." 
> -- Marina Weisband (Green Party)

Oxford English Dictionary definition of System (1928):

1. An organized or connected group of objects.
2. A set of principles, etc.; a scheme, method.

From Greek sistema, An organized whole, government, constitution, a body of men or animals, a musical interval, or a group of connected verses in a poem

From Salter and Kaashoek:

A set of interconnected components that has a specified behavior, observed at the interface with its environment.

The _interface_ is what makes it a system; all outside observers will only interact with the interface. Different observers will interact with/view a different interface or different components of the same interface, depending on their needs. _(Separation of Concerns)_

American Heritage Dictionary definition of Operating System:

>Software designed to control the hardware of a specific data processing system in order to allow users & application programs to make use of it.

Encarta (2007):

>The master control program in a computer


These definitions are aged; it indicates that the central focus of the operating system is to control the hardware, which is no longer the case.


Wikipedia (Jan 2019):

>System software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs.

This definition is more apt because indicates that the operating system manages, rather that controls, resources. (Optimizes Runtime Cost) 

It also provides common functionality/services for other programs to use. This simplifies the software development process. (Optimizes Development Cost)

<h4>Operating System Goals</h4>

  * Protection
      - One program from another
      - From external influences
  * Flexibility
      - Multitasking, etc
  * Simplicity
  * Performance/efficiency
  * Robustness

Example:

```bash
$ls -l big
-rw-r--r-- 1 eggert faculty 922334023480249570 Oct 6 11:31 Big
$time grep x big
real 0m0.009s
```

This gives a scan rate of 8 Zb/s. This is possible because the file contains only 0s, which are ignored by grep.

This demonstrates that Linux meets many of the metrics of operating system success.

<h4>Problems w/ Operating Systems</h4>

  * Tradeoffs
      - Continuing with the above example, if someone on the server did not have read access to the file, they might still be able to deduce its contents with the `ls -ls big` command. This command gives both the disk size and the nominal size, so it is easy to deduce that it is mostly empty.
      - time-space tradeoff in sorting
          + Ideally, you should never need to sort. Sorting sucks.
          + If you have to sort large files/data structures, try to sort indices rather than the files themselves if using qsort. (less copying large files, so faster.) 
      - Authentication/passwords
          + hardware tokens are more secure, passwords are much easier to manage.
  * Incommensurate Scaling
      - Not everything scales at the same rate
          + Diseconomies of Scale (ie star network. Cost increases with square of amount) can cause breaking
          + Economies of Scale (ie manufacturing. Cost reduces as quantity increases) can cause waste
  * Emergent Properties
      - Unanticipated "larger" properties when scaling
          + ie Tacoma Narrows Bridge
          + UCLA dorm network in the 1980s
  * Propogation of Effects
      - A small stimulus in a chaotic system can have a large effect
  * Complexity
      - Moore's Law -- Transistor density doubles every year
      - Kryder's Law -- Disk density grows exponentially
