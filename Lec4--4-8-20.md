<h3>Hypothesis</h3>

  * Hypothesis: something close to just a statement
      - no implication that it is some type of guess
  * Theory itself does not imply that there is a ton of evidence to support somethings
  * How do we use sense data to support/verify a hypothesis?

<h3>Arguments</h3>

  * Premise 1
  * Premise 2
  * ...
  * Premise n
  * ---------
  * Conclusion

<h3>Deductive argument</h3>

  * Truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion
  * If the premises are all true, then the conclusion has to be true as well 
      - Such arguments are "valid" or "valid deductive arguments"
  * Example:
      - If the UCLA campus is closed, then the students are home.
      - The UCLA campus is closed.
      - ----------
      - The students are home.
          + It isn't really possible for the conclusion to be false if the two premises are true.
          + Any time you have a valid deductive arg, the conclusion can only be false if at least one of the premises is false
  * Example invalid arg:
      - If the UCLA campus is closed, the students are home.
      - The students are home.
      - -----
      - The UCLA campus is closed
          + not a valid arg, bc the concl isn't necessarily true, whether or not the premises are true
  * Example of an untrue but valid concl
      - All humans are dolphins
      - All dolphins are tigers
      - ------
      - All humans are tigers
      - valid argument, untrue conclusion, untrue premises

<h3>Modus Ponens</h3>

  * If p then q.
  * p.
  * -----
  * q
  * Arguments of this form are deductively valid

<h3>Modus Tollens</h3>

  * If p then q.
  * Not q.
  * ---
  * not p.
      - Also valid
      - Example: if the camps is closed, the students are home
      - The students are not home
      - ---
      - The campus is not closed

<h3>Induction</h3>

  * induction = not deduction
  * Example:
      - Copper C1 conducts electricity.
      - Copper C2 conducts electricity.
      - ...
      - Copper CN conducts electricity.
      - ---
      - All copper conducts electricity.
          + This isn't deductive -- it isn't necessarily true that all copper conducts electricity from these N examples

<h3>Enumerative induction</h3>

  * Simplest form of induction
  * Premises are an enumeration of various entities, all of which have a certain combination of properties (eg an enumeration of a bunch of swans that are white)
  * Conclusion claims that everything that has the first property also has the second property


<h3>Abductive Inference</h3> 

  * Inference to the best explanation
  * infer the best explanation of a certain phenomenon is true.
  * Ex
      - Evidence that there was a large meteor that hit the Earth 65 million years ago is the presence of rare elements *iridium* in layers of the Earth's crust that are that old. The reason we think the presence of those elements is evidence that a meteor hit is that -- as far as we know -- that is the best explanation of the presence of those elements.

<h3>Problem of Induction</h3>

  * Why is one ever justified in coming to conclusions that do not deductively follow?
      - eg:
      - Emerald 1 is green
      - Emerald 2 is green
      - ...
      - Emerald N is green
      - ----
      - All emeralds are green
  * `cogent`: a good inductive argument
  * Goodman's "grue problem"
  * x is grue if and only if either (x is green and first observed before 2030) or (x is blue and not first observed before 2030)
      - Emerald 1 is grue
      - Emerald 2 is grue
      - ... 
      - Emerald N is grue
      - ---
      - All emeralds are grue
  * Since our observations are all before 2030, this is true. But this suggests that after 2030, all emeralds will be blue. Two inductive arguments that are now cogent might not be so in the future
