<h3>Lec3 Review</h3>

  * one-way functions
      - Probability of finding hte inverse is negligble
  * one-way permutation
      - family of one-way functions that are one-one and onto (from n bits to n bits)
  * __F4.1__
      - As the lengths of the inputs gets bigger and bigger, for every adversary in poly-time, the prob of finding the inverse given the input is negligible

<h3>Weak one-way functions</h3>

  * Factoring primes is super-polynomial (using classical)
  * __F4.2__
  * Factoring random numbers
      - The prob of a random number being prime is 1/n
          + Prob that both are prime is 1/n<sup>2</sup>
      - so, roughly 1/n<sup>2</sup> inputs will be hard, but others might be easy (ie even numbers)
  * f is a weak 1-way function if:
      - f is poly-time computable
      - f input/output size is poly-time related
      - &exist; c, &forall; PPT adversaries and input sufficiently big (&exist; N<sub>c</sub> &forall; x, |x| > N<sub>c</sub>)
      - __F4.3__
  * Additionally, 1/2<sup>300</sup> is basically guaranteed not to occur
      - 2<sup>300</sup> is greater than the number of particles in the universe

  * If &exist; weak 1-way function, &rarr; &exist; (strong) 1-way function

<h3>Hard-core bits</h3>

  * __F4.5__
  * A sends y to bob
      - Given y, we know that BBob has a negligible chance of findinf x<sub>1</sub>...x<sub>n</sub>
  * How can Bob hide his secret B inside the sequence?
  * sending x<sub>1</sub> xor b is not secure enough
      - Suppose we are given f', a one-way permutation from (n-1) to (n-1) bits
      - Now we construct g, a one-way perm from n to n bits
      - g(x<sub>1</sub>, ... x<sub>n</sub>):(x<sub>1</sub>, (f'(x<sub>2</sub>, ... x<sub>n</sub>)))
      - While it might be hard to find all of X, it is trivial to find the first bit of X bc it is given to f'.
  * `Single bit commit protocol`: __F4.6__
      - hiding: after commit phase
          + B cannot predict b with prob > 1/2 + &epsilon;
      - binding: A after commit phase cannot open b in  
  * What works: in the commit, send the xor of b and the dot product of x and the random r (assuming they are the same length)
      - decommit, you just send x
