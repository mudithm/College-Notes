<h3>Theory Ladenness of Observation</h3>

  * The basic idea is that even observation is contaminated by the theory one believes and, hence, not even observation provides a theory-neutral source one can use to evaluate theories

<h3>Norwood Russel Hanson's *Patterns of Discovery*</h3>

  * Hanson wondered whether Tycho Brahe (who thought that the Earth was stationary) and Johannes Kepler (who thought that it moved) see the same thing when they watch a sunrise. (they are both important 16th/17th century Astronomers)
  * He thought that there is a sense in which they do and a sense in which they don't. They do have (roughly) the same retinal reaction, but there is a more robust sense of seeing which involves interpretation. As he put it, seeing is an experience, not just a physical reaction: There is 'more to seeing that meets the eyeball.'
  * An example: the gestalt drawing
      - Necker Cube
      - An example of the fact that "seeing" requires interpretation
      - Do people in different paradigms "see" different things?
  * Another example
      - Visual illusions (like the Muller-Lyer illusion)

<h3>Jerry Fodor (1935 - 2017)</h3>

  *   pointed out that illusions are rather insensitive to changes in belief
  *   So it is not obvious that the high-level cognitive systems that allow us to formulate and believe scientific theories make a difference to the deliverances of our perceptual system

<h3>In what way is observation contaminated by theory?</h3>

  * A theory directs one to make certain observations
      - Einstein's theory of gravitation gave the idea to look for stars behind the sun during an eclipse
      - Newton's theory would not make such an observation very interesting to do
  * The vocabulary in which scientists will actually report an observation depends upon the theory that she believes
      - i.e. Phlogiston vs Oxygen theory
          + flame went out when the air became completely phlogisticated
          + flame went out when the reaction ran out of oxygen
  * Even the most basic vocabulary is theory-laden; there is no neutral description to move to
      - maybe this is true, but only really radically different paradigms would differ on basic stuff (idk)
