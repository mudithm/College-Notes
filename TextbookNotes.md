<h2>Chapter Two -- Logic Plus Empiricism</h2>

---

<h3>2.1 The Empiricist Tradition</h3>

  * Earlier version: `Logical positivism` 
  * Later Version: `Logical empiricism` 
  * Classical forms of empiricism (before positivism)
      - Locke, Berkeley, Hume
      - "The only source of knowledge is experience"
      - based upopn theories abt the mind and how it works
          + view of the mind called `sensationalist`
              * sensations appear in the mind and are all the mind has access to, thought trachsk and responds to patterns in these sensations
  * Probelm w/ empiricism: tendency to lapse into `skepticism`
      - we cannot know anything about the world
      - `external world skepticism`: how can we ever know anything about the real world that lies behind the flow of sensations?
      - `inductive skepticism`: why do we have reason to think that the patterns in past experience will also hold in the future?
  * `Phenomilalism`: our concept of the world is just a concept of a patterned collection of sensations
  * Empiricists have often tended to think of the mind as *confined* behind sensations
  * `Rationalists` (Decartes, Leibniz): pure reasoning can be a route to konwledge that does not depend on experience
  * Kant's intermediate position: all ourthinking invoves an interaction between experience and preexisting mental structures that we use to make sense of experience
      - key concepts (space, time, causation) cannot be derived fr experience, bc a person myst already have these concepts in order to use experience to learn abt the world
      - Math also gives real insight but doesn't rely on experience
  * Empiricist tradition tended to be:
      - pro-cience
      - worldly raitehr than religious
      - politicaly moderate or liberal (as far as that applied to the times)

<h3>2.2 The Vienna Circle</h3>

  * `Logical Positivism`: form of emp., dev'd in Europe after WW1
  * Est by group of scientifically oriented peeps who disliked the state of Phil at the time
      - group known as the `Vienna Circle`
      - Moritz Schlick, Otto Neuraths
      - Based in Vienna Austria
      - Central Intellectual fucgre: `Rudolf Carnap` 
  * `Positivism` came from the philosophy of Auguste Comte
  * Name changed from Logical Positivism to Logical Empiricism
      - Positivism was more intense, earlier
      - Empiricism was more moderate
      - The ideas changed most markedly after WW2
  * Logical Pos insp by dev in science in early 1900s, incl Einstein's works
      - Thought that devs in Logic, Math, and phil of language could settle problems that phil had been concerned with
      - Views on Language infl by `Ludwig Wittgenstein` 
          + phil of logic and language, not an empirricist at all
  * Log positivists were diestessed with the state of Phil
      - Saw `G. W. F. Hegel` as a villain
          + Hegel was famous for work on the relation bt philosophy and history
          + thought that human history as a whole was a process in which a "world spirit" graduually reached consciousness of itself
          + inds were less importnat than the state as a whole, esp the role of the state in the frand march of hist progress
              * these ideas taken to support strong forms of nationalism
          + A single reality as a whole is said to have a spiritual or rational character -- `absolute idalism` 
      - In such idealism, factual meaning is somethered with miusused language (in the mind of the logical empiricists)
  * `Heidegger`
      - existentialist (sometimes)
      - We must understand our lives as based,, first and foremost, upon practical copint with the world rather than knowedge of it
      - all our exp is aff by the awareness that we are trav tw death, so we shd look it in the face and live an authentic life
      - Opposed liberal demovratic political ideas
  * Logical Positivism was a plea for Enlg. Val's, in opposition to romanticism, mysticism, and nationalism (they were kind of dem soc)
  * Log Pos traveleld to England, and Eng abandoned Abs idealism and returejd to trad empiricist emphasis
  * Log Pos peeps were persecuted by the Nazis, and many fled to US. Heidegger joined the Nazis
      - Carnap, Reichenack, Hempel, and Feigl fled to US

<h3>2.3 Central Ideas of Logical Positivism</h3>

  * based on a gen'l theory of language
  * `Analytic-synthetic distinction` and the `verifiability theory of meaning` 
  * Analytic-syntheti distinction
      - some sentences are true or false in virtue of their meaning, regardless of the world (analytic)
          + "All bachelors are unmarried"
      - Some are true or false in virtue of both the meaning of the sentence *and* how the world actually is (synthetic)
          + "All bachelors are bald" (false, synthetic)
      - analytic-synthetic intro'd by Kant
          + log pos peeps claimed that all math and logic is analytic
          + math props do not describe the wrold, they record our conventional decisions to use symbols in a particular way
          + The only things that are konwable a priori are analytic and hence empty of factual content
      - Einstein's rev work showd that non-Euclidean geom is true in our world, caising log pos peeps to split Geom into two parts: purely mathematical analytic part, and a set of synthetic claims about which geometrical system applies to our world

You really do be taking to many notes, tone it down in future
