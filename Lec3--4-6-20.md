<h3>Empiricism/Rationalism/Metaphysics</h3>

  * Empiricism
      - All substantial knowledge comes from the senses
      - Locke, Berkeley, Hume
  * Rationalism
      - there are synthetic a priori claims
      - We can know substantive things without the senses
      - Descartes, Leibniz, Spinoza
          + Leibniz -- Vis-viva (1/2 mv<sup>2</sup> for momentum)
  * Metaphysics
      - the investigation of the parts of reality that we cannot know about through the senses
  * Galileo

<h3>The Verification Theory of Meaning</h3>

  * A (non-analytic) statement is only meaningful if it is verifiable by sense experience
  * we acquire knowledge of language through senses, so in some sense there should be some relationship between language and the senses
  * Explains why Philosophy is hard to understand

<h3>Positivists on Einstein</h3>

  * Einstein brought questions of simultaneity into the realm of the "meaningful"
      - That which can be proven/verified by senses
      - This brought interesting surprises

<h3>External World Problem</h3>

  * If the world exists or is just a sensory phenomenon
      - According to the Verif Theory of meaning, there is no philosophical problem that is both hard and meaningful

<h3>Verifi -- able</h3>

  * The concept of "verifiable" is ambiguous
  * is it
      - verifiable "in practice"
          + perhaps too strong of a requirement
      - verifiable "in principle"
          + it might be possible to verify, we just don't yet have the technology to do so (still too strong)
          + knowing what it would take to verify something
  * What does "verify" mean?
      - come to know with "certainty"
          + makes a bunch of claims unverifiable
      - there is some evidence suggesting the claim

<h3>Contradictions</h3>

  * According to its own concept of meaning, the Verification Theory of Meaning is not meaningful
  * This is one of the reasons that it is
