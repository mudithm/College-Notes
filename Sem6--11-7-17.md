**The Future of Robotic Space Exploration**

<h6>1936: JPL's First 5 employees</h6>
  * Students of Professor von Something
  * "banished" from the Caltech campus because of their experiments with rockets, etc

<h6>1958: America's First Satellite JPL's Explorer 2</h6>
  * The first US satellite in space, built at JPL
  * The second in satellite overall after Sputnik
*JPL hires 800 summer interns every year*

<h6>History,  Evolution, and Future state of our solar system</h6>

  * is p old tbh
  * Is there life beyond Earth?
  * The snowblower effect:  
      - Heavy particles are closer to the sun, lighter, gassier particles are further our. The solar wind is blowing particles outwards

<h6>Future destinations in our solar system</h6>

  * Europa
      - Around 30 years ago, it was discovered by the Galileo spacecraft that there was a large ocean underneath the ocean of Europa.
      - Tested via instruments that measured the magnetic field between Europa and Jupiter. It measured the exact signature predicted for an ocean beneath Europa's icy surface.
  * Titan
      - Have remarkable methane liquid oceans & other indications of liquid
  * Enceladus
      - Has active geysers of water
      - We didn't know that there was liquid water outside of earth until a decade ago.
  * Venus
  * Asteroids
  * Dark Side of the Moon

<h6>Mars Exploration Program</h6> 

  * We have had continuous robotic presence on Mars since 1987
  * After curiosity, there are more planned explorations in the future
  * Much of the ability to land the satellite is entirely dependent on the accuracy of the robots sensors and computer calculations.

<h6>The Computer Science Point of View</h6> 

  * Since there is a significant delay signaling from the earth to mars, everything must be done completely autonomously.

 A bow shock is created around the solar system in the interstellar medium surrounding it as it moves through 

 *Einsteins work shows that gravity bends light. THe solar gravity lens focus is the means by which they plan to extend the range of telescopes, using the suns gravity like a lens.*


  * Using the sun to accelerate, and use the thermal energy of the sun to vaporize liquids and provide large quantities of thrust.
  * To image them, using a large origami using star shade memes
      - smallish folded memes that can unfold to very large
      - blocks the light so that images can be more easily taken.
  * There are a shitload of galaxies, as evidenced by images from the Hubble telescope

<h5>Future Enabling Capabilities</h5>

<h6>Miniaturization in Space and Satellite Development</h6>

  * Akin to the shrinking of mainframe computers to cell phones, satellites are being shrunk to between 10 and 100 kgs, much smaller compared to the satellites of the past. They are real satellites, and they are entirely capable of performing scientific research.
  * MarCo (Mars Cube One)
      - Going to carry 2 Cubesats
      - Investigating the interior of mars, with seismic tech etc
      - Cubesats can help landers, etc, and reduce the dangers of certain operations
  * The industry is increasingly making small satellites

Also working with AI, VR, AR, and other things to interact with.
