For every variable declared, the compiler will put it somewhere in memory.

Two cancellation rules with pointers:

    ...
    *&x; // This returs the object pointed to by the pointer that leads to x, or just x

    &*p; // This returns the pointer to the object that p is pointing to (This only works if p is a pointer), or just p


When iterating using pointers, the following logic applies:

    int da [10];

    for (dp = &da[0]; ...; dp++){
        *dp = 3.6;
    }

The code above will set each element of da to 3.6, incrementing the pointer with each iteration.

How this works:

    dp = &da[i];
    dp++ = &da[i] + 1;
         = &da[i+1];

The same logic applies when using the -- operator as well.

    dp = &da[i];
    dp-- = &da[i] - 1;
         = &da[i-1];
