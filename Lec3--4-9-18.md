__ISA:__ Instruction set architecture

<h4>CISC</h4> 

__CISC:__ Complex Instruction set computer

  * Instructions can have differing lengths
  * developed for several reasons, including because memory was a limited resources
  * __RISC:__ Reduced Instruction Set Computer
      - have fixed-length, limited instructions
      - prolly more efficient/better performance with current tech
      - MIPS and ARM

__CC:__ Condition Code
__RF:__ Register File
__RIP:__ Instruction something

>__Spilling:__ When you run out of space in your register and swap out data to and from the register

>In x86 systems, you can directly access memory, but in RISC systems, every bit of data you process has to go through your registers.

<h6>Accessing memory without using registers</h6>

  * `mov`: copying data from one location to another (`movq src,dest`)
      - IMM: immediate-encodes the actual value
          + mov imm: move the actual data
          + mov imm reg/mem: move the actual value to reg/mem 
      - REG: register file
          + move reg: move the data in the reg at the 4-bit address given
          + move reg reg/mem: '' '' '' '' '' to reg/mem
      - MEM: memory location
          + mov mem: move the data to memory at the address given
          + move mem reg: '' '' '' '' '' '' to reg
              * can't move from mem to mem with this version of `movq`
      - For REG operations, (%rax) acts like a dereference, returning the value at the memory address in that register 
  * `lea`: load effective address (`leaq src,dest`)
      - Does not actually access memory
