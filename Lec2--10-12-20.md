<h4>Lessons from Last Session</h4>

  * Negotiation is totally learnable
      - It might require more effort from some, but showing up & being present is a key to learning
  * Exercise 1: Silent Negotiation
      - Talking is only one form of communication
          + When our communication is limited, we have to resort to other tools to be
      - Goals (at a high level)
          + Hide your bottom line (reserve price), and find out your partner's bottom line
      - Tactics: extreme anchoring, controlling expression, non-verbal communication
      - Understand that the cues that you see might not be what the person actually feels -- learn to detect when someone is sincere and when someone is just trying to get a better deal 
  * Exercise 2: Roosevelt Campaign Strategy and Copyrighted Image
      - People's ideas of acceptable behavior can be very different
          + What you might consider fine behavior might be deplorable to another
      - Think about the other person's perspective
          + What are their motivations?
          + How might they be thinking?
          + How can you reframe your position to seem more amenable to the other side?
              * Don't assume anything about what the terms of the deal should be
              * Don't assume the other side knows everything you do
          + What is reasonable and ethical to share about your position?
              * There is (usually) no ethical obligation to reveal information that might be detrimental to your position (as long as it isn't asked for)
          + All that said, if you feel that you're misleading someone or taking advantage of something, you should think carefully before proceeding.

<h4>Negotiation Exercise -- The Ugli Orange</h4>

  * One thing to keep in mind -- it can be very meaningful how you frame your negotiation
      - whether its cooperative (a partnership)
      - or oppositional/adversarial (a competition)
      - This can make a significant psychological difference
      - Ideally, we want to treat negotiations as a collaborative exercise (usually)

  * Very important takeaway -- Thoroughly read your requirements and be clear with your precise needs!
      - both sides had high stakes, time sensitive needs
      - There was very little trust between the two companies
      - there was a limited supply, and both sides needed all (or most) of it
      - However, both sides needed different parts of the orange, which was made clear by a thorough reading of the requirements
          + Our team assumed that the other needed the same part of the orange as the other -- this was a failure of communication

  * Key points to reflect on
      - Be truthful
      - Share a clear picture of your goals
      - Ask questions and *listen*
          + What do you want/need?
          + What can you live without?
          + What constraints do you have?
              * Time
              * Financial
              * Existence of alternatives
          + **What are your goals?**
          + **What exactly do you need from this?**
