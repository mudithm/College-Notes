<h4>Lessons from Last Session</h4>

  * Negotiation is totally learnable
      - It might require more effort from some, but showing up & being present is a key to learning
  * Exercise 1: Silent Negotiation
      - Talking is only one form of communication
          + When our communication is limited, we have to resort to other tools to be
      - Goals (at a high level)
          + Hide your bottom line (reserve price), and find out your partner's bottom line
      - Tactics: extreme anchoring, controlling expression, non-verbal communication
      - Understand that the cues that you see might not be what the person actually feels -- learn to detect when someone is sincere and when someone is just trying to get a better deal 
  * Exercise 2: Roosevelt Campaign Strategy and Copyrighted Image
      - People's ideas of acceptable behavior can be very different
          + What you might consider fine behavior might be deplorable to another
      - Think about the other person's perspective
          + What are their motivations?
          + How might they be thinking?
          + How can you reframe your position to seem more amenable to the other side?
              * Don't assume anything about what the terms of the deal should be
              * Don't assume the other side knows everything you do
          + What is reasonable and ethical to share about your position?
              * There is (usually) no ethical obligation to reveal information that might be detrimental to your position (as long as it isn't asked for)
          + All that said, if you feel that you're misleading someone or taking advantage of something, you should think carefully before proceeding.

<h4>Negotiation Exercise -- The Ugli Orange</h4>

  * One thing to keep in mind -- it can be very meaningful how you frame your negotiation
      - whether its cooperative (a partnership)
      - or oppositional/adversarial (a competition)
      - This can make a significant psychological difference
      - Ideally, we want to treat negotiations as a collaborative exercise (usually)

  * Very important takeaway -- Thoroughly read your requirements and be clear with your precise needs!
      - both sides had high stakes, time sensitive needs
      - There was very little trust between the two companies
      - there was a limited supply, and both sides needed all (or most) of it
      - However, both sides needed different parts of the orange, which was made clear by a thorough reading of the requirements
          + Our team assumed that the other needed the same part of the orange as the other
              * this was a failure of communication

  * Key points to reflect on
      - Be truthful
      - Share a clear picture of your goals
      - Ask questions and *listen*
          + What do you want/need?
          + What can you live without?
          + What constraints do you have?
              * Time
              * Financial
              * Existence of alternatives
          + **What are your goals?**
          + **What exactly do you need from this?**

<h4>Negotiation</h4>

  * An interactive process of communication among 2+ parties (preparing, asking questions, listening, discussing each party's goals/interests, positions) when each party wants something of value from the other(s), with the goal of resulting in a durable agreement/settlement where both parties are better off than they would be without a deal

<h4>What do we mean when we talk about Ethics?</h4>

  * It's a general set of expectations (norms) and guidelines (set by individuals and society) by which actions are judged
  * It can be very subjective -- different cultures/ideologies can influence what's considered ethical, where values can be similar but their manifestations are different
  * It might have the ultimate aim of minimizing cruelty/suffering among people
  * Some laws can provide a ethical framework, but not all do
  * Some people derive their ethical framework from religion
  * An important consideration is the "golden rule" (do unto others), but this can't always apply

<h4> More Terms</h4>

  * Reservation price
      - Your bottom line -- the least you can do as a seller or the most as a buyer
  * Aspiration Price
      - Your ideal price -- the best price you think you can reasonably obtain
  * Bargaining Zone -- the region between both party's reservation prices
      - ZOPA -- Zone of possible agreement
  * BATNA
      - Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement
          + Example: If you're negotiating with a Honda dealer for a used car, and the dealer is unreasonable, your BATNA might be a Toyota
      - You always need to know what your alternatives are (and/or develop them), and think about what the other side's alternatives are
          + If you can do so ethically, you want to try to control their alternatives
              * or their perceptions of their alternatives
      - Maintaining really good BATNAs is a way to maximize your leverage in a negotiation, but it takes work
      - Another thing to keep in mind -- who has the most to lose by not making a deal?
  * `Framing`
