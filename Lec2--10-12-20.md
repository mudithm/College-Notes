<h4>Lessons from Last Session</h4>

  * Negotiation is totally learnable
      - It might require more effort from some, but showing up & being present is a key to learning
  * Exercise 1: Silent Negotiation
      - Talking is only one form of communication
          + When our communication is limited, we have to resort to other tools to be
      - Goals (at a high level)
          + Hide your bottom line (reserve price), and find out your partner's bottom line
      - Tactics: extreme anchoring, controlling expression, non-verbal communication
      - Understand that the cues that you see might not be what the person actually feels -- learn to detect when someone is sincere and when someone is just trying to get a better deal 
  * Exercise 2: Roosevelt Campaign Strategy and Copyrighted Image
      - People's ideas of acceptable behavior can be very different
          + What you might consider fine behavior might be deplorable to another
      - Think about the other person's perspective
          + What are their motivations?
          + How might they be thinking?
          + How can you reframe your position to seem more amenable to the other side?
              * Don't assume anything about what the terms of the deal should be
              * Don't assume the other side knows everything you do
          + What is reasonable and ethical to share about your position?
              * There is (usually) no ethical obligation to reveal information that might be detrimental to your postition (as long as it isn't asked for)
          + All that said, if you feel that you're misleading someone or taking advantage of something, you should think carefully before proceeding.
