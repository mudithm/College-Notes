<h1>Lecture 1</h1>

<h4>What is Python?</h4>

  * Not just a scripting language
  * OO language
      - Classes
      - member functions
  * Compiled and Interpreted
      - Python code is compiled to bytecode
      - Bytecode is then interpreted by the python interpreter

---

<h4>Optparse Library</h4> 

  * Powerful Library for parsing command-line options
      - Argument:
          + String entered on the command line and passed in to the script
          + Elements of sys.argv[1:](sys.argv[0] is the name of the program being executed -- mainly for error/debugging purposes)
      - Option:
          + An argument that supplies extra information to customize the execution of the program
      - Option Argument:
          + an argument that follows an option and is closely associated with it. It is consumed from the argument list when the option is

<h4>Python List</h4>

  * Like a C array, but also
      - Dynamic: expands as new items are added
      - Heterogeneous: can hold objects of different types
  * How to access:
      - List_Name[index]

<h4>List operations</h4>

  * Adding an item:
      - `list.append(5)` 
  * Merging Lists:
      - `merged_list = list1 + list2` 
  * As you can see, these operations are much simpler than they would be in C or Java, or other lower level languages.

---

<h4>Loops in Python</h4>

  * `for` loops:

```python
for item in list:
    print item

for i in range (len(list)):
    print list[i]

```
>The default lower bound for `range` is 0, and its upper bound is not included.. The two default loops are a foreach loop and a for loop over a range.

---

<h4>Indentation</h4>

  * Python has no braces or keywords for code blocks
      - C delimiter: `{}` 
      - Bash delimiter: `if, fi, do, done`, etc 
  * Indentation is very important (tabs change code's meaning!) 

---


<h4>Python 2 and 3</h4>

  * Python has two main versions atm
  * `Python 2.xx` and `Python 3.xx` 
  * To see your version, you use
    - `python -v` or `python --version`

Example python code:

```python

#!/usr/bin/python


import random, sys
from optparse import OptionParser


class ClassName:
    def __init__(self, otherArgument):
        self.f = "Some Value"
        #other member variables and functions


def main():
    #this is where some code goes

main()
```

>The shebang line specifies the location of the python installation to be used
The `self` keyword acts like "this", passing the object into its own scope. To declare a member variable, use the `self.varName` syntax in the class definition. Each member function must include self as the first parameter

To return multiple values, use the syntax

`return val2, val1`

and to assign these values to variables,

`x,y = functionThatReturnsTwoValue()`
