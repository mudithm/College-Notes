<h3>Thomas Kuhn on scientific revolutions</h3>

  * A paradigm will not be rejected until there is another paradigm to take its place
  * In the shift from one paradigm to another, there are losses as well as gains
  * Kuhn uses several metaphors to describe the shift:
      - It is like a "revolution"
          + like a political rev: suddenly under a new regime
      - like a "Conversion experience"
      - like a "gestalt shift"
          + when your perception suddenly changes
      - Shift is not necessarily rationally persuaded

<h3>Gestalt Shifts</h3>

  * Gestalt drawing: can be interpreted in different ways
      - ie Necker Cube
      - ambiguous at some sense
  * Cannot view it in two ways at the same time
  * Sometimes your mind shifts between interpretations
  * Can't necessarily be changed through persuasion -- the mind just kind of shifts
      - Kuhn is at least downplaying the role that reason & evidence plays in these shifts in viewpoint

<h3>Kuhn's claims</h3>

  * Different paradigms are incommensurable: they are not comparable by any neutral standard
  * It isn't even easy to tell where they differ
  * They might seem to differ due to their usage of different vocabulary, but maybe they are saying the same thing
      - It's as if scientists working in different paradigms speak in completely different languages
  * They might seem to contradict each other but really be using the same vocabulary in different ways
      - maybe they are using the same words with different meanings
      - relativistic mass does depend on its velocity, but Newtonian mass might not. These might not be a contradiction

<h3>Is Kuhn a relativist (in the philosophical sense?)</h3>

  * Relativism is the idea that what is true depends upon what people believe
  * Why does he seem to be a relativist?
  * Because he says that people in different paradigms "live in different worlds"

<h3>The principle of Economy</h3>

  * Don't posit more than you need to!
  * Kuhn thinks there is no need to posit the one world that makes one paradigm correct and the other incorrect
      - There is nothing outside of our paradigm that indicates that another paradigm is incorrect
