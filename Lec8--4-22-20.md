<h3>Pseudo random generators</h3>

  * Super PRG
      - exponential possible outputs
      - PRG(s, i) gives the ith bit of the output of the PRG on S.
  * This is what a PRF is.

<h3>Side not about PRG security</h3>

  * If PRG(s) = w
      - |s| = log|w|
  * then PRG is not secure.
  * Proof:
      - PRG runs for at least |w| steps. So enumerating all possible seeds of length log|w| takes w steps (2<sup>log|w|</sup>=w)
      - For each of these, the adverary can test if the output is an output of the PRG or random, hence it can distinguish with probability 1 (minus some very small prob (prob that random and PRG is the same)).
      - (basically can generate a lookup table from input to output in a poly time related to the time it takes to generate w.)

<h3>PRF Function as a game.</h3>

  * __F8.1__
  * PRF is secure if no poly-time judge can distinguish between World 1 and World 2.
  * World 1 is a table of truly random values
  * World 2 passes a random seed to the PRF.
      - Judge can be adaptive (ask questions based on previous responses, etc)
  * __F8.2__
  * All members of secret society are given S to the PRF
  * Even if an outsider E knows some of the entries of the table, it cannot hope to guess every possible combination of the
  * GGM PRF construction
      - binary tree construction
          + Walk left or right in the tree depending on the bits of i
          + You don't have to evaluate the whole tree, just compute PRG on each step and repeat it on either the first half or the second half, depending on the output
