<h3>Def of Proof</h3>

  * A proof is a combination of mathematical notation and English that gives a convincing argument for that which you are trying to prove

<h3>Models of Computers, Computations, and Problems</h3>

  * `Alphabet` &#x2261; any non-empty finite set
      - its elements are "symbols"
          + except `&epsilon;` is not allowed as a symbol, for reasons described later
      - If you treat a set as an alphabet, the elements of that set are symbols, if they are the elements of the alphabet
  * `strings`/`words` &#x2261; finite sequence of symbols (concatenated together)
      - e.g., with alphabet &sum; = {0, 1}
      - Words: 0, 1, 00, 01, ...
          + This is an infinite set, but each element is a finite string
              * indefinitely long, not infinitely long
  * &sum;<sup>+</sup> &#x2261; {0, 1, 00, 01, ...}
      - Given a finite alphabet, putting a plus sign like above gives the set of all strings that can be constructed with the given alphabet
      - This is NOT the power set
  * `Concatenation`: represented by the symbol &sdot;
      - `11 = 1 &sdot; 1` 
      - `1&sdot;01=101=10&sdot;1` 
  * `Language over &sum;` &#x2261; set of words over alphabet &sum;
      - {00, 01, 10, 11}
      - {} -- The "empty language"
  *  Concatenation of Languages
      -  __F2.1__
      -  This operation is not necessarily commutative
          +  Order matters; the elements in the language that precedes the concat operator will be placed in front of elements from the other set 
      -  Note: concatenating with the emtpy set results in the empty set.   
      -  Concatenation of languages requires that both sets contain elements; otherwise, the resultant set will be empty.

<h3>More concatenation</h3>

  * __F2.2__
      - This is sort of analagous to multiplication, with the exception of commutative -- order matters.
  * Is there a "1" equivalent?
      - ie _&sdot;W = W = _&sdot;W
  * Yes; this is represented by &epsilon; &#x2261; the empty string
      -   &epsilon;&sdot;W = W =  &epsilon;&sdot;W
  * `Length of a word, w` &#x2261; the number of symbols of w
      - |w|=
  * &sum;<sup>*</sup> &#x2261; &sum;<sup>+</sup> &#8746; {&epsilon;}
