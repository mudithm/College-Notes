  * Comparison bt Boniface/Philip and Gregory/Henry

<h4>Steps of the Controversy</h4>

  * Philip wants to tax from the clergy without the Pope's permission
      - Pope issues the bull "Clericos Laicos" -- no taxation of the clergy unless the Pope approves
      - 1301 Question of jurisdiction -- Bishop Pamiers
          + did some crimes and prolly didnt pay taxes
      - 1302 "Unam Sanctum"
          + real extreme meme
          + church realized that he went to far
          + claimed absolute rule over sovereigns and the church (more than cardinals, etc)
      - 1303 Pope Boniface dies, and Philip attempts to put him on trial posthumously
  * French territorial sovereignty won out

>Consolidation of political organization and institutions

>Philip the Fair as a manifestatio nof the strength of France

>Pope loses an important battle, but church as a whole is still very vital

>Spiritual vitality: Franciscans and Dominicans

  * Mid 1300s: Black plague
      - some blamed the Jews
      - some thought it was airborne

<h4>Black Plague</h4>

  * Between the late 1330s and the early 1350s, roughly 1/3 of peeps in Europe died
  * Agriculture collapses bc peeps could not farm
  * Economy collapses: nobody has the energy to work
  * Other side:
      - Europe WAS overpopd
      - less people meant lower food costs
      - less people working meant harder workers and better wages
      - authority of monarchs is highly increased

<h4>The Hundred Years' War (1337-1453)</h4>

  * War bt France and England over territory in France
  * First phase: looked like England was gaining ground
  * Second phase: France kicks England out of Continental Europe

      - "Go home to your own country" type beat
  * Consequences of the War

      - civil wars in both England and France
      - Monarchy holds out (Look at slides)
      - England pays a steeper price (War of the Roses)
