__Problems with cin and input:__

If cin is reading for an integer, it reads up to the new line character and stops, leaving the newline untouched. If the next input statement is a getline, it sees this newline and immediately execures, assigining an empty string to the variable. 

_How Input Works_

_Action_ | OS Writes | OS Holds | Available to Program | _Action_
---|---:|---:|---:|---
Pgm does: getline(cin, s); | | | | Program waits
You type x | X | X | | 
You type y | y | xy | | 
you type backspace | bs sp bs | X | | 
You type z | z | xz | | 
You type Enter | cr lf * | | x y newline |
 | | | | Getline executes
 | | | | s gets "xz"


*Character Return (cr) sends the cursor to the beginning of a line, and Line Feed {lf} moves the cursor down one line.

_Action_ | OS Writes | OS Holds | Available to Program | _Action_
---|---:|---:|---:|---
Pgm does: cin >> i; | | | | Program waits
You type 3 | 3 | 3 | | 
You type 2 | 2 | 32 | | 
You type Enter | cr lf * | | 3 2 newline |
 | | | | cin >> i executes
 | | | newline | sets i to "32"
Pgm does: getline(cin, s); | | | newline | 
 | | | | getline(cin, s); executes
 | | | | sets s to ""

To fix this issue, add __*cin.ignore(10000, '\n');*__
>How it works: read up to {parameter 1} characters until you find {parameter 2}. 

_Action_ | OS Writes | OS Holds | Available to Program | _Action_

 | | | | Getline executes
 | | | | sets s to whatever value you type

<h3>A return to Hourly Wage</h3>


    #include <iostream>

    using namespace std;

    int main(){

        double hoursWorked, payRate;

        cout << "How many hours did you work?  ";
        cin >> hoursWorked;
        
        cout << "What is your hourly rate of pay?  ";   
        cin >> payRate;
        
        double amtEarned = hoursWorked * payRate;
        
        cout.setf(ios::fixed);
        cout.precision(2);
        
        cout << "You earned " << amtEarned << "." << endl; 
        
        double withholdingRate;
        if (payRate >= 14.00)
                withholdingRate = .1;
        else           
                withholdingRate = .05;
        cout << "$" << amtEarned * withholdingRate << " will be withheld." << endl;

        if (payRate < 10.00)
            cout << "Ask for a raise!"

    }

*Variables declared within if/else statements are restricted in scope to only withing their branch of the statement.*


__Declaration with initialization:__ type variableName = value;
__Assignment Statement:__ variableName = value;


An example of if statements with strings:

    ...
    cout << "What is your name?  ";
    string name;
    getline(cin, name);

    if (name == "")
        cout << "You didn't type a name!" << endl;
    else
        cout << "Hello, " << name << "." << endl;

    ...



Or statements:

    ...
    if (country == "US" || country == "Canada")
        cout << "You qualify for..."
    ...
