<h1>Virtual Memory</h1>

---

  * Memory is shared bt RAM and disk
  * BC multiple programs might want more RAM than you can supply

<h4>Virtual Memory</h4>

  * changes how much mem can be allocated to a program at any given time (eg if one program needs very little memory, but another requires more)
  * Different address spaces for different programs (so that the same memory addresses can be used by different programs at the same time)
      - Can have both protection and sharing enabled
  *
