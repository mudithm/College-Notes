<h3>Kuhn</h3>

  * Descriptive vs Prescriptive/Normative
      - what is done vs what should be done
  * Paradigm
      - view of the world, set of conceptual structures, a way of doing science/how science should be done, exemplar
      - Examples:
          + Newton's law of motion
          + Einstein's theory of relativity
          + Darwin's theory of evolution
          + Skinner's behaviorism in psychology
  * Stages of Scientific development
      - for a field, 
      - Pre-paradigm science: not well org'd, not very effective
          + striking discovery
      - normal science: well-organized, agreed upon standards; puzzle solving
          + Critical mass of anomalies and a rival paradigm emerging
      - Crisis: losing faith in the old paradigm, no new paradigm established 
      - Revolution: old paradigm rejected, new paradigm established ("Gestalt shift")
          + Two paradigms are incommensurable, different "languages", revolutions are non-cumulative
  * Shouldn't immediately discard a paradigm upon the emergence of an anomaly, but once a critical mass of anomalies arise, one should consider doing so
