<h1>Discussion 3</h1>

For strings, both str.size() and str.length() work to find the length of the string.

WHen used on a string, the [] operator accesses a single character of the string.

When concatenating strings, you cannot add a variable string to a constant, but you can add a constant string to a variable.

EG
    string s = "String";

    "String" += s; // Invalid statement.
    s += "String"; // Valid statement.

You can also concatenate a char to a string variable, but not add two constants or add a constant string to a variable char.

EG
    string s = "Strin";
    char g = 'g';

    cout << s + g << endl;
    s += g; //Legit food review
    s += 'g'; // Nonlegit food review

If you try to use the + operator to concatenate two chars, however, you will receive an integer output of the sum of their character values. Thiss is because a char can only hold one character, so concatenation between chars is not defined.

<h6>Substring</h6>

Syntax:

```c++
    string s = "This is a string. WOW!";

    string p = s.substring(5,3);

    /*  The format is str.substring(startCharacter, lengthOfSubstring); */
```

<h6>cctype library</h6>

    #include <cctype>

contains

1. isalpha(c);
2. isdigit(c);
3. isupper(c);
4. islower(c);
5. toupper(c);
6. tolower(c);

Which do some pretty self-explanatory things.
