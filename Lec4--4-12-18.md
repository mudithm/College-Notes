<h4>The Eastern Roman Empire</h4>

<h6>Justinian</h6>

  * Mix of Roman, Christian, and Asian (mostly persion)
  * Analagous to Charlemagne, who was a mix of Frank, Roman, and Christian

<h6>Justinian Code</h6>

  * Funded by Justinian
  * Collection of every law ever issued by Rome
  * The only way that we know of Roman law until the 13th century with canon law (church law)


<h6>Less "Roman" and more "Christian"</h6>

  * Christianity becomes central to society
  * Patriarch of Constantinople
  * Greek philosophy and adoption of the Trinity
      - easier to accept bc of a polytheistic past
      - Holy spirit is an emanation of both the father and the son 
          + (filioque)
      - Greek Orthodox:
          + Father above Son above Holy Spirit
  * Iconoclasm: destroying images (by Greeks mostly)
      - peeps thought that worshipping images of God was memeage.
  * 1054: The Great Schism

<h6>The Empire Shrinks</h6>

  * The gains of the Muslim empire came at the cost of the Eastern Roman Empire
  * Look at the slides for the 8th and 9th century... a lot of info
  * Byzantine army "Themes" (provinces)
      - One army per theme
      - A kind of early federalsim
      - decentralized power

<h6>Byzantine Commerce</h6>

  * Eastern Roman Empire did not have enough farmland to sustain itself by traditional means
  * commerce became their economic backbone
  * controlled key points in the maritime trade

<h4>By the 10th century:</h4>

  * Muslim world was intellectualy vivacious and politically divided
  * Eastern empire is gaining some ground, where previously the Muslims had been on the offensive
  * Western Europe:
      - Charlemagne and the HRE undergo a political, religious, and cultural renaissance
      - Political unrest leads to Feudalism in the Frankish Kingdom
          + Authority of the King lessens, and high leaders become more powerful
          + power becomes less centralized
      - Vassal and Lord relationship:
          + reciprocal exchange of homage + faith

<h4>What is the point?</h4>

  * Decentralization leads to an increased emphasis on personal relationships and loyalty
  * hierarchical structure develops
  * lack of centralization
  * Tention bt center and periphery (EG capitularies)
  * Importance of public displays
      - Ceremonies and spectacles were displays of authority, etc

<h6>As time goes on...</h6>

  * private vassalages multiply (hierarchical structure becomes more and more intricate and fragile)
  * No enforced form of standardization
  * The lord overshadows the king (bc he is the only one that you interact with)
  * vassalage becomes hereditary rather than being subject to the king and/or lord
      - bc superiors have limited ability to enforce shibb
      - Tenure: territorial concession, which at first was temp but became permanent (kings were originally meant to lend land out and get it back, etc)
      - fiefs

>_The Lord (in the secular sense) was the protagonist of Early Medieval life_

<h4>Serfs</h4>

  * Freemen were free to move, etc, serfs were tied to their land/fief

<h6>Living in a Castle</h6>

  * Rule of primogeniture
      - firstborn son inherits everything
      - If there is no son, the fief is divided among the daughters
          + linked with loss of property, weakening of fief, fragmentation
      - __Look at slides for more detail__
      - girls often went to convents

  * The knights
      - only men
      - must own their own horse 
          + must be independently wealthy
      - Must not be firstborn to a nobleman
      - product of political fragmentation and a society of constant war
          + no regular army existed, so...

<h4>Source: Fulbert of Chartres to William of Aquitaine (1020)</h4>

  * Role of Church as an advisory but still dependent entity
  * Church has piety, theological legitimacy
  * somewhat ambivalent relationship bt religoys and political entities
  * --
  * Relationship bt Feudal Lord and Vassal is recipro cal
      - mutual respect
      - consequences to violating the terms of this relationship
          + "perfidious and perjured"
          + both _moral_ and _legal_ consequences
  * Writes with a certain degree of expectation that it will be read by others
      - ******
  * What does a vassal have to do?
  * Who does he have to be?
  * How about the second source?
  * What does it concern?
  * Do you see some similarities?
