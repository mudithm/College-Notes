<h4>From last time:</h4>

  * From feudal France to Italian "Comuni": the commercial revolution
      - Surplus and money market
      - market centers and urban development
      - "comenda" venture capitalists
      - artisans
  * Holy Roman Empire: Politics and Religion
      - main central authority after the death of Charlemagne
  * Emperors appointing Bishops
      - What happens if Pope is not chill with this?
      - Chickens come home to roost
      - Bishops cannot pass territory to their progeny bc they can't have legitimate children
      - Popes were not chill with this (gregory)
      - continues in...

<h4>Investiture Controversy</h4>

  * Emperor Henry IV threatening to depose Pope
  * Pope excommunicates Henry
  * Arguments according to the source:
      - Main Arguments
      - _should not say "fighting over power" in midterm essays--should be more specific than that_
          + _Power over what?_
      - Fight over who is closer to God, who has more religious right to God
      - Emperor
          + Jesus affirmed divine authority to rule (divine origin of political authority)
          + St Peter: fear God, honor the king
      - Pope
          + Successor of Peter, PRINCE of the apostles
          + affirmation of the suptreme spiritual and POLITICAL nature of his authority
              * Being the leader of the church should give him the authority to rule over the people as well
          + He won bc he excommuicated Henry
              * This made all of his subjects unable to associate with him
      - 4 days and 4 nights until Henry was un-excommunicated (Canossa)

<h4>Thus, by the end of he 11th century:</h4>

  * Wealth and prosperity in Eu
      - germany mostly
  * Diff forms of polit organization
  * Huge vict for the pope
      - biggest pope until Bonifice
  * Papacy and religion stronger than ever
      - Stronger hold over royal line
      - start to attack "enemies," those who do not accede to the authority of the Pope
