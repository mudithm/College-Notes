<h3>What is a computer?</h3>

1. Inputs
2. Outputs
3. Program
4. Storage
5. Initial State
6. Deterministic
7. Do a finite number of things at a time
8. Problem the computer is solving
9. Classes of problems

<h3>Diagram: <b>F1.1</b></h3>
  * Each category subsumes those that are beneath it
  * The power increases the higher the language is (ie, context-free languages can do more complex things than finite-state languages)
  * However, they also reduuce in 
      - understandability
      - predictability
      - analyzability
  * Exampeles of these: 
      - Finite State Automata
      - PDA
      - Turing Machine

<h3>Analog to Language</h3>

  * Computation
  * Set Recognition
  * Language Recognition

<h3>Diagram: <b>F1.2</b></h3>

  * Lightbulb on: statement accepted as valid
  * Lightbulb off: statement not accepted as valid
  * Eg: given the `2+3=5`, it will be off until it reaches the 5, because before that there is not a valid statement
  * The box will have some initial state and will be deterministic
  * 3: Program
  * 4: Storage
  * Finite state machine:
      - From initial state, it follows the 2 branch
      - then, it follows the + branch
      - etc until it reaches the end of the statements, which will represent an "on" signal for the bulb (Accepting state)
      - Every node has a branch for every possible input signal EXACTLY once
          + The graphs are the program, the nodes are like storage and the branches are like control
      - This is the type of computer model we will be using

__F1.3__
  * Alphabet {0, 1}
  * All inputs have an even number of 1's
  * Initial state heads to E
  * Two nodes, e and o
  * each node has branches for each possible input signal
