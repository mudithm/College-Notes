<h1>Titan -- 11-16-17</h1>

<h5>Titan Facts</h5>

  * Largest moon of Saturn
  * Diameter of 5151km
  * Bulk composition is water ice nad rock
  * Only known satellite with a dense atmosphere (1.45 atm)
  * Surface Temperature is araound -180 C
  * In some way similar to earth (liquids are some things)
  * Methane-Nitrogen Atmosphere

<h6>Cassini Hyugens Mission, 1997-2017</h6>

  * One of the most ambitious missions
  * loaded with an array of powerful instruments and camersd
      - capable of taking precise measurements of atmospheric condiditons and light spectra
  * Comprised of the Cassini orbiter and Huygens Probe
  * Reached in 2004, 7 years after its launch
  * Huygens entered the murky atmosphere to its surface (Jan 2005)

<h6>Titan by the Numbers</h6>

  * Discovered a global subsurface water ocean
  * Rivers of hydrocarbons on its surface
  * 35 Named hydrocarbon lakes and seas

The satellite was cast into Saturn and destroyed in 2017, as its energy ran out.

<h6>Titan's Atmosphere</h6>

  * 98.4% Nitrogen
  * 1.4% Methane
  * Rest hydrogen and other hydrocarbons
  * Presence of methane in atmostphere suggests that it must be replenished by a reservoir or witihn Titan itself (released by cryovolcanoes)
  * The atmosphere preiodically rains liquid methain and other organic compounds onto is surface.

<h6>The formation of Titan's Haze</h6>

  * Formation of aerosols that make up the haze on Titan
  * Nitrogen and methane molecules are broken up by sunlight

<h6>Titan's Surface</h6>

  * Difficult to scan due to Titan's dense atmosphere
  * Complex, fluid-processed, geologically young
  * Rough and smooth areas
  * 20% of the surface is covered by dunes, made of particles covered by or consisting of organics (sedimented tholins)
  * Methane/Hydrocarbon Lakes and Seas
  * Beaches made of Benzene and Acetylene
  * Methane/hydrocarbon rivers with a length of more than 400 km
  * Detection of 40-Ar in the atmosphere indicates that cryptovolcanoes exist, spawning plumes of "lava" composed of water and ammonia (and maybe methane)


<h6>Titan's Subsurface</h6>

  * The surface can rise and fall by up to 10 meters during orbit
      - suggests that the interior is deformable
      - likely a thick float atop a subsurface ocean
  * Titan's shape is more football like closer to Saturn, and more spherical when further out
  * A subsurface ocean may lie no more than 100 km beneath the surface
  * This ocean could be very "salty," with the salt being ammonia
