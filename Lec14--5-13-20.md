<h3>Recap</h3>

  * Van Fraasen does not think this is a reasonable aim to have because he believves a strong thesis about the undeterminination of theory by evidence
  *  Mary Hesse's (1924 - 2016)
  * UDT 1: For any given theory T, which is acceptable on the basis of some body of evidence R, there is at least one other incompatible and acceptable theory T', which is empirically equivalent to T
  * UDT 2: At any given time, there are always alternative theories such that (a) they are given some degree of support by available evidence, and (b) they imply incompatible real worlds

<h3>Why think there is always an empirically equivalent rival to a theory T?</h3>
  
  * Because one can construct them
  * T: Quantum Electrodynamics
  * T': The world appears to be as QED says, but it isn't
      - more specific, try "but there are no electrons"
  * Isn't this only the sort of example a philosopher can love? Are there more substantive examples of empirically equivalent theories?

<h3>Double Slit Experiment</h3>

  * Two explanations for reality:
      - Quantum Mechanics with Collapse
      - Bohmian Quantum Mechanics
  * Perhaps these are not substantively different, they mean the same true
  * What might be the grounds for choosing one over the other?
      - One might be simpler


<h3>Back to Van Fraassen</h3>

  * Why does he thing a thesis like UDT 1 renders the second version of scientific realism untenable?
  * We cannot discover unobservable reality
      - so discovering unobservable reality is not a reasonable aim to have
  * What is the aim of science, then?
      - To give "empirically adequate" theories, theories that make all of the right predictions when it comes to the observable world
  * Contrary to what the first sort of realist thinks, we do not have good reasons to believe our best theories according to vF.
  * He does think, though, that we should "accept" them
      - For him, to accept a theory is to believe that it is empirically adequate. That it correctly predicts the observable phenomena within its domain
  * But accepting a theory does not involve believing it is right about the unobservable world -- it only involves believing what it says about the observable world

<h3>Observability</h3>

  * What counts as observable? where is the observable/unobservable cut off?
  * Do instruments like microscopes and telescopes provide knowledge?
  * Van Fraassen thinks telescopes can but microscopes can't
  * We can check whether telescopes reveal how things genuinely are independently of any theory of how they work. He thinks that is not so for microscopes
  * Kind of a "theory-ladenness" of instrumentation

<h3>Ian Hacking</h3>

  * You can show that "shrinking" an object (through some photographic process) and looking at it through the microscope to see the original shape
  * The inference to the best explanation
