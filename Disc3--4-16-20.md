<h3>Definitions</h3>

  * Demarcation problem
      - the problem of delineating the difference between genuine science and pseudo-science
  * Decision
      - term of art by Popper
      - acceptance of an observation report was a decision
  * Corroborated
      - term of art by Popper
      - a theory that has survived many attempts to falsify it

<h3>Theory</h3> 

  * Problem of induction (arguments)
      - how inductive reasoning works, how to justify it, and what qualifies some inductions as better than others
  * Problem of confirmation (evidence and theory)
      - When does X count as evidence for Y? Is there a rational logic of confirmation?

<h3>Group Problem</h3> 

  * What is Popper's view on induction and confirmation respectively? Why?
      - induction: thought that it wasn't a valid scientific way of looking at things
          + you cannot s
      - Evidence cannot directly confirm a theory, because to do so it would need to use inductions
  * What is Popper's solution to the demarcation problem? And what is his two step method for doing science?
      - a theory should have risks and be testable, and it should then be tested
      - pseudoscience has claims that can be bent to fit any outcome
  * What is Quine's holism about the testability (or the Quine-Duhem thesis)? How does it pose challenge to Popper? How does it pose a problem for verification theory of meaning?
      - Individual statements can't be falsified on their own, you have to look at them in context with other related statements
      - Verification theory of meaning: log pos's said that statements on their own should be verifiable, but quine says that they depend on other things
  * What are other challenges to Popper's solution for the demarcation problem?
      - Accuracy of our observation reports
          + Ultimately we have to "decide" whether or not to accept the accuracy of observations, and that itself are not necessarily deductive
      - scientific progress might lead to a change in what is considered falsifiable
      - Probabilistic predictions cannot necessarily be falsified (eg quantum mechanics)


<h3>Applying Falsification</h3>

  * Hypothetico-deductive method
  * Hypothetic-deductivism
      - confirm a generalization when one of its consequences turns out to be true
  * Hypothetico-deductive method
      - deduce observational predictions from conjectures. If prediction turns out to be true, then the theory is supported. otherwise, rejected

<h3>Analytic/Synthetic distinction Quine</h3>

  * Hallmarks of analytic statements
      - Experiments cannot force you to give it up
      - Experiment cannot even suggest that it is false
  * Electrons are negatively charged
      - Might it be that, depending on the time, electrons are either neutral particles *or* negatively charged?
      - How can we confirm or deny this statement with an experiment?
