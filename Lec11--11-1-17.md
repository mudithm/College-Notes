<h4>Continuing with Arrays and Stuff like that</h4>

Arrays are passed by reference unless specified by the `const` tag in the function definition.

c++ strings:

``` c++
    #include <string>
    using namespace std;

    string t = "Hello";
    string s = t + "!!!"; // "Hello!!!"
    // comparing strings

    first mismatch, whichever is alphabetically after, is considered greater
```


If you want to pass a value into a c library, you must use strings as c understands them.

c strings:

``` c++
    #include <cstring>

    ...

     
    char s[100];
    
    char t[9] = { 'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'};
    // OR
    char t[9] = "Hello";
    char s[100] = ""; // initialized to the empty string, or just the 0 byte.
    const int 0;

    char meme = '\0'; // This is known as the zero byte.
```

`strlen(cstring)` gives the length of a cstring.

say we do

``` c++
    t[0] = 'J';
    cout << strlen(t); << endl;
    cout << t << endl; // write hello
    cout << "Enter the string for s:  ";
    cin.getline(s, 100);
```


**Arrays cannot be assigned!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

to copy a cstring:

``` c++
    strcpy(s, t); // strcpy(destination, source);
```

The destination must be equal to or greater than the length of the source string.
