<h3>Agenda</h3>

  * Union  Bounds
  * Hardcore Bits
      - Game based def
      - no error proof
      - 3/4 error proof
  * Computaional indistinguishability
      - one-sample &rArr; many sample
          + Hybrid argument
  * PRG
      - Definition
      - construction using Hardcore Bits
      - Next Bit Test

<h3>Union Bound</h3>

  * x &larr; {1, ..., 5}
      - x sampled from 1-5
  * E<sub>1</sub> = x is divisible by 2
  * E<sub>2</sub> = x is divisible by 4
  * not divisible by 2 &rArr; not divisible by 4

<h3>Hardcore Bits</h3>

  * f is some one-way permutation
  * Goldreich-Levin
  * Game-based definition
  * Sources of randomness:  
      - generating both x and r, on the challenger side
      - Generating b' in PPT, on the adversary side
