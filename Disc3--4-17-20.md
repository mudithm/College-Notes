<h3>Regular Expression</h3> 

  * w contains exactly one 1
      - 0*10*
  * at least one 1
      - &Sigma;*1&Sigma;&ast;
  * contains 0101 as a substring
  * &Sigma;*0101&Sigma;&ast;
  * odd length
      - (&Sigma;<sup>2</sup>)*&Sigma;
  * length is divisible by 3
      - (&Simga;<sup>3</sup>)* &equiv; (&Sigma;&Sigma;&Sigma;)<sup>*</sup>
  * first symbol = last symbol
      - 1&Sigma;<sup>*</sup>1 &cup; 0&Sigma;<sup>&ast;</sup>0 &cup; &Sigma;
  * no 2 one's adjacent
      - 0&ast;(100&ast;)&ast;(1&cup;&epsilon;)
  * Doesn't contain 0101 as a substring
      - this is much harder

<h3>Context Free Grammars</h3>

  * {0, 1}*
      - V: {S}
      - &Sigma;: {0, 1}
      - R: 
          + S &rarr; 0 | 1 | &epsilon; | SS
      - S
  * balanced parentheses
      - V: {S}
      - &Sigma;: { (, ) }
      - R:
          + S &rarr; () | (S) | SS | &epsilon;
      - S
  * palindromes
      - V: {S}
      - &Sigma;: { 0, 1 }
      - R:
          + S &rarr; 0S0 | 1S1 | 0 | 1 | &epsilon;
      - S

<h3>Pumping Lemma</h3>

  * L = reguular language &rArr; &exist; DFA D that recognizes L
      - p = number of states
          + ie p = 6
      - word of length &ge; p in L
          + s = bbaabbaa
      - While traversing a machine, if you visit more than the number of states + 1, you made a cycle somethwere in the path
      - __D3.1__
          + Two states occur among the first p+1 states
      - If our langauge is regular, then 
          + there exists p such that for any s &isin; L: |s| &ge; p, a cycle occurs in the first p symbols.
          + &exist; p st &forall; x, y, z &isin; &Sigma;<sup>*</sup>: s = xyz st |y| &ge; 1, |xy| &le; p, xy<sup>i</sup>z &isin; L &forall; i
              * since there is a cycle somewhere in y, any concatenation of ys  surrounded by x and z means that it is still in the language
              * "pumpable"
  * Note: there are languages that are non-regular but pumpable: but if not pumpable, cannot be regular.

<h3>Contrapositive</h3>

  * If a language is not pumpable &rArr; not regular
  * So we need to prove that L is not pumpable to prove that it is not regular
      - Adversarial approach: break any proof that L is pumpable
  * Pumping
