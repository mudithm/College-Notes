<h3>Niccolo Machiavelli (1469 - 1527)</h3>

<h4>The Italian Wars</h4>

  * The comuni: like city-states
      - Powerful at the local level, but cannot compete with larger nation-states
      - Had to form alliances
      - Biggest player was France
          + King of france started planning to conquer Northern Italy bc they shared a border
          + Pope gets mad and organizes an alliance, the League of Venice
              * battle of Fornovo, France lost the least. Still had to return to France. Signified beginning of Italian Wars
  * After Lorenzo de Medici (il Magnifico) No leader strong enough to unify Italy
      - leads to constant war in Italy

<h4>Machiavelli and Florentine Politics</h4>

  * 1492 il Magnifico dies
  * 1494 Medicis kicked out, Republic is established in Florence
  * 1512 Medicis come back, no more Republic
  * 1527 Medicis get kicked out again, republic is back
  * 1531 Medicis come back
  * Machiavelli
      - 1498 Machiavelli elected second chancellor
      - 1498-1512 Machiavelli as a diplomat and as a chancellor to the Nine of the Militia
      - 1512 Medicis come back and No more Machiavelli
      - 1513 Machiavelli is arrested and then exiled
          + He wants to come back and work for the Medicis, so that he can stay politically active
      - 1527 Republic returns, but Machiavelli is ignored, and he dies later that year

<h4>Machiavelli the Humanist: letter to Vettori</h4>

  * Leads a very quotidian lifestyle, but looks down on it
  * returns to home and studies the classics, his true passion
      - the only thing that is worthy of him

<h4>Machiavelli the political theorist: a mystery still to unfold</h4>

  * 1513 The prince: dedicated to Lorenzo de' Medici the younger

<h4>The Prince</h4>

  * NOT a praise of monarchy
      - it is a study of 
  * NOT a study of "the ends justified the means," or if it is, what is the "end," and what are the "means?" 
      - End: keep yourself in power
  * NOT an invitation to violence
      - or rather, violence in moderation
  * The Passages:
      - Ch 15: it remains therefore...
          + effectual truth rather then speculation/imagination
      - Ch 17: autonomy of politics
          + politics is separate from religion (not better/worse, just separate)
          + feared s/t does not acquire love, escapes hatred
          + humans are fickle, often bring out the worst in themselves
      - Ch 8:
          + unnecessary violence.
          + VIolence as a tool after being in power, or violence to gain that power in the first place
