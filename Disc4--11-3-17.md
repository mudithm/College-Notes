<h4>C Strings</h4>

<h4>Why use C strings</h4>

 * Many libraries are written in C
 * C strings are faster

<h4>Recap of C strings</h4>

  * C string: an array of chars
  * terminated by '\0'
  * No '\0' leads to trouble. 
      - The compiler will keep searching memory until it finds a null character.

<h4>Declarations</h4>

  * `char s[10];`
  * `char t[10] = {'h'. 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '!', '\0'};`
  * `char t[10] = "hello!";`
  * `char t[10] = "hello!\0" // DON'T DO THIS! IT IS UNNECESSARY`

<h4>Output and Input Strings</h4>

You can't just output a CString using cout. You must loop through the elements in the string.

<h4>Copying CStrings</h4>

You cannot simply assign the value of a CString to another.

``` c++ 
    char a[] = "destination";
    char b[] = "source";
    a = b; // This will produce an error, this is undefined behavior. It will
    // either cause a compilation error or cause another error to occur.
```

<h4>Comparing and Manipulating CStrings</h4>

``` c++    
    int main(){
        char b[8] == "good";
        cout << strlen(b) << endl;
        
        // To copy a CString to another char array, use the strcpy function
        char c[8];
        strcpy(b, c);
        
        // To concatenate CStrings, use the strcat function.
        char source[7] = "there!";
        char destination[20] = "Hi";
        strcat(source,  destination); //or you can use strcat_s() if you get an error

        // To compare CStrings, use the strcmp function.
        char meme[] = "meme";
        char memer[] = "memer";
        cout << strcmp(meme, memer); // Output will be -1


    }



```

<h4>Arrays of CStrings</h4>

An array of CStrings is a 2D array of characters.

Each row represents one cstring, each column is an index of letters in the array.

to initialize it, do the following:

``` c++        
        const int MAXLEN = 199;
        char a[10][MAXLEN];
        strcpy(a[0], "hello");
        cin.getline(a[1], MAXLEN); // The cin.getline function takes a char 
                                   // array and a length as its arguments.

```

<h4>Arrays in Functions</h4>

By default, arrays passed into functions are passed by reference.
