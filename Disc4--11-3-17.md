<h4>C Strings</h4>

<h6>Why use C strings</h6>
 * Many libraries are written in C
 * C strings are faster

<h6>Recap of C strings</h6>
  * C string: an array of chars
  * terminated by '\0'
  * No '\0' leads to trouble. 
      - The compiler will keep searching memory until it finds a null character.

<h6>Declarations</h6>
  * char s[10];
  * char t[10] = {'h'. 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '!', '\0'};
  * char t[10] = "hello!";
  * char t[10] = "hello!\0" // DON'T DO THIS! IT IS UNNECESSARY

<h6>Output and Input Strings</h6>

You can't just output a CString using cout. You must loop through the elements in the string.

<h6>Copying CStrings</h6>

You cannot simply assign the value of a CString to another.

    char a[] = "destination";
    char b[] = "source";
    a = b; // This will produce an error, this is undefined behavior. It will either cause a compilation error or cause memes to occur.

<h6>Comparing and Manipulating CStrings</h6>

``` c++    
    //After they say that my name is jeff and that I like memes.
    int main(){
        char b[8] == "good";
        cout << strlen(b) << endl;
        
        // To copy a CString to another char array, use the strcpy function
        char c[8];
        strcpy(b, c);
        // To concatenate CStrings, use the strcat function.
        char source[7] = "there!";
        char destination[20] = "Hi";
        strcat(source,  destination); //or you can use strcat_s() if you get an error


    }
