<h5>Efficiency</h5>

  * There are different ways to do things in programming, but some will be more efficient

Things to keep in mind for CS32:

  * Start Early
  * Develop Incrementally
  * Read what we write

Interface | vs | Implementation
---|---|---
"What" | vs | "How"
How users are going to use this type | vs | How the type performs these actions

Example: A Drawing Program

``` c++

    #include <iostream>

    using namespace std;

    class Circle{
        // some memes go here
        // Pretend that there are the proper function
        // declarations here

        public:
            Circle(double xCor, double yCor, double radius);
            void scale(double factor);
            void draw();
    };

    double area(Circle c);


    int main(){
        Circle blah(6, -5, 3);
        // We first realize that these seem like reasonable
        // parameters tor a circle. We then decide how to 
        // implement this circle

        Circle c(-2, 5, 10);
        c.scale(2);
        c.draw();

        cout << area(c); // note that in this scenario, the
                         // function area is a non-member 
                         // function. 
    }
```

This program will compile, but it will not work as intended (since none of the member functions are implemented).

In the process of creating an executable, there is a combination of Compliation and Linking.

Stipulations for Creating an Executable

  * All needs are met
  * Exactly one main function
  * All functions defined

Linker errors are usually marked by `undefined symbol` or `unresolved reference`.
