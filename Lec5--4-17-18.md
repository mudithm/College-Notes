<h4>if you feel lost</h4>

  * look at slides
  * outline book
  * put primary sources in their specific historical context
  * oftentimes the info we get is from propoganda
      - what they want us to remember, not necessarily what happened

<h4>From last time</h4>

  * Political and Social Unrest in Post Carolingian Europe
  * 'France' feudalism
      - actual france is not yet memed
      - king of france losing political power to his lords
          + hereditary power structure develops
      - Lack of centralization
  * knights and knighthoos were necessary
      - product of war
      - had to be independently wealthy
      - usually second sons, 
      - primogeniture
      - small-scale fief wars

<h3>Other models of Government (alt to Feudalism</h3>

<h4>'Italy' (in the Italian peninsula)</h4>

  * Comuni
      - as urban as was possible in the Middle Ages
      - no castles
      - commerce-based rather than agariculture based
          + kind of like the Eastern Roman Empire / Byzantium
      - originated as marketplaces and grew into communities
          + political consequence of an economic development
      - "consorteria" social structure
          + corporation type meme
          + horizontal alliances bt people working the same trade/in the same social class
              * not the patriarcal line of inheritanace
              * lobbies/guilds, etc
  * Commercial Revolution
      - increase in population
          + no famine
          + decent production
          + absence of major wars
      - Greater productivity, usually agriculture
      - development of a money market
          + excess product could be traded/sold
          + required a more robuts money system
      - New commercial markets open around castles and in towns

<h4>Medieval "Venture" capitalism</h4>

  * 'commenda'
      - ways to allow investors to put money into larger enterprises (split into multiple enterprises)
          + ie investing a little into a bunch of ships as a group, so small losses are covered by large-scale gains
          + offset the risk
      - Usury is forbidden, but  
          + for religious reasons, peeps were not supposed to make profit
          + "good christians" lend money without asking for interest
          + "late payment fee" was the excuse
              * church turns a blind eye
      - Commerce brings about the "artisan" class
          + mostly own their own means of production
          + small scale tho
          + food, clothes, glass, etc.
              * manufactured goods
  * Guilds were between a corporation and a trade union
  * Social, political, and religious implications

<h4>Politics: Italy</h4>

  * Guilds and commerce very strong
  * 'Commende' and proto-banks are very strong
      - commende were comprised of the investor class, guilds were of the working class
      - C were income based, G were occupation based
  * Political life organized around cities
  * full developments of the Comuni
      - mini city-states
      - social, political, and religious vitality

<h4>Comuni and Independence: Milan, 1097</h4> 

  * Who 'ruled' Italy?
      - Bishops (ie gregory and his influence over the lombards)
  * Comuni want independence from their Bishops
  * Milan succeeds in 1097, and the other cities in North and Central italy follow suit
      - first time an aristocracy of money forms rather than one ruled by noble blood or religious justification

Many more examples of Political systems in the Tbook

<h4>Germany: HREmperor Otto 1</h4>

  * Secrets to his success
      - Military strength (won against Italy and the Slavs)
      - Used his indluence to appoint aristorcatic supporters and Bishops:
          + bc Bishops could not have legitimate kids, territory returns to the king after death
          + bishoprics could not be inherited
      - Church, politics, and money = SIMONY
      - Curch loses its influence in HRE in the 10th and 11th century
  * All these things were intensified by his succesors.
  * Church is in trouble, "paying" for becoming bishops, hence simony
  * Church and empire in trouble: what happens if the Pope and the Emperor fall out?

<h4>Political Situation</h4>

  * NOT-SO-STRONG-KING
      - Henry III dies in 1056 and Henry IV is weak
  * Strong pope, Gregory VII
  * Gregory VII vs Henry IV over investitures
      - Pope removes the right of the emperor to give investitures
  * Henry IV tries to depose the Pope
  * Pope excommunicates Henry IV

<h4>Source: Communications bt Gregory VII v Henry IV</h4>

  * Pope to Emperor:
      - U are a son of the church, whereas I am the successor to the prince of apostles
      - put respec on my name
  * Emperor to Pope:
      - God made me king, not you
      - My legacy is chillin
      - I am to be judged by God alone
      - Peter says "Fear god, honor the king"
