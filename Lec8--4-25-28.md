<h4>Floating point representation</h4>

<h6>Normalized:</h6>

  * Nominal range [1.0, 2.0)
  * 1.xxxxxx
  * 32 Bit:
      - 1 bit for sign
      - 8 bits for `exp`
      - 23 bits for `M`/`frac`
      - `E` (the power of 2 you want) = `exp` (the number you encode for representation) - `bias` (specific to the architecture)
      - Eg: `1.01101 x 2^3`
          + `E` is 3, and the `bias` is 127, so the `exp` is 130
          + encoding: `0 10000010 01101000000000000000000` 

<h6>Denormalized</h6>

  * if `exp = 0`, denormalized
  * `E` = 1 - `Bias`

<h4>Special Values</h4>

  * `exp` is all 1's, and  `M/frac` is all 0s
      - value is infinity (positive or negative)
  * `exp` is all 1's, and `M/frac` is anything but 0
      - value is `NaN`, not a number
