<h4>What is a computer network</h4>

  * Wireless (Wifi) communication and cellular connectivity
  * Typically, gigantic datacenters, LAN and many processors, etc
  * Newer stuf: localized, wireless signals, etc

<h4>Terminology</h4>

  * Millions of connected computing devices
      - `hosts` = end systems
          + phones, laptops, etc
      - they run `network apps` 
      - which send and receive `data packets` 
          + packet is a bag of bits
          + networks deliver lots and lots of bags of bits
  * `routers` = `packet switches` inside the network
      - middle of the network
      - deliver packets
      - forward packets to intended destination
  * `communication links` 
      - Fiber, copper, radio, satellite
      - transmission rate = `bandwidth` 
  * Lots of these diff pieces, connected together, is a network
      - Some of the components: mobile networks, global ISP, home network, regional ISP, institutional network (ie UCLA)
  * For two parties in such a network to communicate, they need a common language to understand eachother
      - These languages are known as Protocols

<h4>Nuts and Bolts</h4>

  * `Internet` -- Network of networks
      - Interconnected ISP's
  * `Protocols` define how to sent, receive packets
      - eg, TCP, IP, HTTP, 802.11
  * `Internet Protocol Standards` 
      - `RFC`: request for comments
          + IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force
      - IEEE Standards
      - W3C
      - and others

<h4>What are protocols</h4>
  * Human protocols: greetings, saying by, etc
  * Traffic lights: green means go, red means stop, etc
  * standards make life easier
      - Specific messages are sent, and specific actions are taken when the messages are received

<h4>Internet Protools</h4>

An example:

| Local PC | Server | 
| --- | --- |
| Sends a TCP connection request | --- |
| --- | Sends a connection response | 
| Sends a get request | --- | 
| --- | Sends a file |
| ... | ... |

  * Comunication betwen machines rather than humans
  * all communciation activity governed by protocols
  * `protocols` define `format`, `order` of `packets sent and received` among network entities, and `actions taken` on packet transmission, receipt

<h4>Internet Protocol Stack</h4>

  * Application layer protocols
      - support data exchange between app, processes
      - ex: ftp, smtp, http
  * Transport layer protocols
      - handling delivery, reliability, multiplex within a host
      - ensure that the packet actually reaches the destination, etc
      - ex: TCP, UDP
  * Network layer protocols
      - forward packets from source to destination
      - figure out which direction to send to packet to continue it on its ay to its destination
      - ex: IP
  * Link layer protocols
      - transfer dya between directly connected network elements
      - ex: Ethernet protocol, WiFi
  * Physical Layer
      - bits "on the wire"
      - voltages, etc associated with specific actions

---

<h4>Application View</h4>

  * There are application programs
      - Client side: Chrome, Safari, Firefox
      - Server side: Apache, etc
  * Application Protocols
      - Asume network can send data to any hosts on the Internet
      - Don't know/care how the data is sent, only whether it is delivered reliably
      - Runs on top of a transport protocol which sets up a pipe between two

<h4>Transport View</h4>
  
  * Transport protocol's job: delivering data between the two communicating ends
      - don't know or care about which paths data may traverse through the network
  * Multiple transport protocols exist, each offering somewhat different functions
      - eg reliability, congestion control
  * New transport protocol being introduced by the IETF, QUIC
  * They actually don't do real delivery, they just mark the packages

<h4>Network Layer view</h4>

  * Network protocol's job: forward packets from some source to destination host
  * A really hard problem: the internet is large, run by many didfferent parties
      - connection from Laptop to CNN.com
          + Wifi -> Campus backbone -> ISP -> Other ISP -> CNN Website
          + Nowadays, you might not even go through any ISP's at all (through some large datacenter, or google, etc)
              * Google, Netflix, Amazon, etc all have their own networks
                  - Internet Decentralization

<h4>Link Layer View</h4>

  * Link Layer's job: get a packet transmitted across some communication medium to next "hop"
  * Different medium (wifi, cellular, etc) -> different link layer protocol

<h4>Physical Layer</h4>
  * That's some EE shibb

---

<h4>What a protocol "layer" really means</h4>

  * when you send a letter to someone, you have content, and an envelope
      - The envelope is the protocol
      - Transport protocol delivers packets to the right port
      - The layers of the envelope (idk this metaphor is sus) are like the layers of headers/metadata that are associated with the information that you send

---

<h4>Packet Switching: <i>Statistical Multiplexing</i></h4>

  * Each node sends packets as soon as a link is available
  * the receiver gets a full packet first, then forwards it towards the destination
      - Statistical multiplexing, as opposed to reservations
      - Downside: if many computers are trying to send something through the same router, it can get congested as its buffer fills up; packets can be dropped in that case.
      - Store-and-forward
      - Packet switch can termporarily buffer up packets
          + Introduce delay 
          + packets get dropped when the queue is full
          + However, because network tech is p fast rn, the delay is often dominated by propagation delay (physical limitaitons of how fast information can be sent over wires, etc)

---

<h3>Performance</h3>

<h4>Throughput</h4>

  * Throughput over a single link
      - Point-to-point
          + pumping data to the pipe: throughput = link bandwidth
      - multi-acccess
          + d
      - Throughput between two hosts:

<h4>Packet Losses</h4>

  * wireless links
      - limited transmission rate

<h4>Delay in Packet-Switched Networks</h4>

  * 4 sources of delay at each hop
  * Node processing:
      - check bit errors
      - determine output link
  * Queueing
      - = # packets in queue * transmission time of each packet
  * transmission = L / R
      - R = link bandwidth (bps)
      - L = packet length (bits)
  * Propagation = d/s
      - d = length of physical link
      - s = propagation speed in medium (~2*10^8 m/sec)
  * Example: calculating one hop delay
      - Link length: 100km
      - Bandwidth = 1Mbps
      - packet size = 1000 bits
      - 2 packets ahead in queue
  * Queueing delay = waiting for 2 packets
  * transmission delay = 1.000 bits / 1,000,000 bits/sec = 1 msec
  * propagation delay = 100,000 m / 2 * 10^8 m/sec = 0.5 msec
  * = 1ms*2 (waiting time) + 1ms (transmission time) + .5ms (propagation delay) = 3.5ms

<h5>Packet-switching: store-and-forward</h5>

  * Takes L/R seconds to transmit (push out_ the packet of L bits on to the link of R bps)
  * Entire packet must arrive at router before it can be transmitted on next link: `store and forward` 
  * Example 1:
      - send L, A -> B
      - L = 8000 bits
      - Bandwidth R = 2 Mbps
      - Ignore propagation Delay
          + Delay = 3L/R, 
  * Example 2:
      - A sends 5 packets to B
      - L = 8000 Bits, R = 2Mbps
          + ignore propagation delay
      - How long does it take starting from A sending the first bit of first packet till B receives the last bit of the last packet?

<h4>Network Latency</h4>

  * Time to send 1 packet from point A to point B
      - sum of the delays across each hop along the path
      - Delay_ab = Delay_a1 + Delay_12 + Delay_23 + Delay_2b
  * Round trip time (RTT)
      - RTT_ab = Delay_ab + Delay_ba
