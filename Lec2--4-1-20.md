<h3>Logical Positivists</h3>

  * Schlick
      - killed by a student
  * Carnap
      - S and C in Vienna Circle
  * Reichenbach
      - in Berlin
      - R and C taught at UCLA
  * Main ideas
      - Analytic/synthetic distinctin
      - verficiation theory of meaning

<h3>The Analytic/Synthetic Distinction</h3>

  * Analytic Statements
      - True or false in virtue of the worlds they contained
      - `Bachelors are unmarried.`
          + Bachelor can be described by "unmarried" and "male," along with some other descriptors/concepts
          + So this is true by definition (`Unmarrieds are unmarried`)
      - `Triangles have three angles` 
          + Triangle can be described by "three angled", "polygon", etc
          + So this is true by definition (`Three angled polygons have three angles`)
      - Nothing about the world can make these statements untrue (made neither true nor false by the world)
  * Synthetic Statements
      - `Bachelors are younger than 300 years old`
          + Not necessarily true; while it is true now, it might be possible that an unmarried male lived to more than 300 years old. So, the truth of this statement depends on the world.
      - `Triangels have angles that sm to 180 degrees` 
          + This depends on your decomposition of Triangles
              * If you decide that the fact that the angles sum to 180 degrees, then it is analytic; otherwise, it is synthetic
  * Note: this is a semantic distinction

<h3>The a priori/a posteriori distinction</h3>

  * An a priori statement is one that is knowablr independently of (and prior to) sense experience in some sense
  * An a posteriori statement is knowable only by sense experience
      - You can't know whether or not something is true just by thinking about it
  * Note: this is an epistemological distinction

| ... | A priori | A posteriori |
| --: | :-: | :-: |
| Analytic | &#10004;  | &#10008; |
| Synthetic | ? | &#10004; | 

  * Kant thought that Synthetic A Priori claims were possible, but Log Positivists did not
      - If that were the case, you could know things about the world without any experience
