<h4>Regular Expressions</h4>

  * `.`: Any one character
  * `\`: Usually turns off the special meaning of a special character
      - ie `\\` to represent slash, `\/`, `\.`, etc.
      - can also turn on some functionality for specific characters
          + `\(`, `\)`, etc
  * `*`: match any number (or none) of the preceding character (or, for ERE, a regular expression)
  * `^`: match the following regular expression at the beginning of the line or string. 
      - ie `^a` would match with `apple` but not `_apple` 
  * `$`: match the preceding regular expression at the end of the line
      - ie `a$` would match `conga` but not `conga_` 
  * `[]`: matches any one of the enclosed characters. NOT the whole string, just individual characters.
      - `[A-Za-z]` would match `a` but not `3`.
  * `\{n,m\}`: matches an exact number of the preceding character. With just `n`, an exact match, with both `n` and `m`, a range from `n` to `m`. (inclusive)
      - Leave either `n` or `m` blank for an unlimited range.
          + `{,6}` up to 6
          + `{3,}` at least 3

<h4>More Regular Expressions</h4>

  * `+`: One or more of the preceding character/regex
  * `?`: Zero or one of the preceding character/regex
  * `|`: Match the regular expression specified before or after the pipe
  * `()`: enclose a string of characters to be affected by a regex symbol
      - `(this)*` 0  or more instances of "this"

<h4>POSIX bracket expressions</h4>

| Class | Matching Characters | 
| --- | --- | 
| [:alnum:] | alphanumeric characters |
| [:alpha:] | alphabetic characters |
| [:blank:] | space and tab characters |
| [:cntrl:] | control characters |
| [:digit:] | numeric characters |
| [:graph:] | nonspace chars |
| [:lower:] | lowercase characters |
| [:print:] | printable characters |

<h4>Searching for Text</h4>

  * `grep`: uses basic regular expressions (BRE)
      - meta characters `? + { | ( and )` lose their special meaning; instead use the backslashed versions
  * `egrep` or `grep -E`: uses extended regular expressions -- no backslashes needed
  * `fgrep` or `grep -F`  matches fixed strings instead of regular expressions

<h4>Simple <code>grep</code>:</h4>

  * Feed some data to `grep`'s `stdin`
  * filter some regex or fixed string
  * output to `stdout`

---

<h4><code>sed</code></h4>

  * Extracts and allows for substitution of text
  * Substitute mode: `sed '/s/regular exp/replacement exp/[g]'`
  * to delete, you can use the delete mode or use the substitution mode with an empty replacement expression
      - ex: `sed 's/target../someexp`
  * `g`: global. replaces all occurrences of the expression, not just the first.
