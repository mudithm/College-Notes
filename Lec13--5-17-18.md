      - Invention of printing press

      - started among the elite, became widespread
  * HUGE religious trauma
      - Roots in old christianity
      - contributed to the end of the pre-modern world, ushered in modernity
  * Politics:
      - Beginning of the domination of nation states

<h4>Three issues</h4>

  * Luther's background and the beginning of the reformation
  * Luther's reformation theology
  * The role of Politics

<h4>Luther</h4>

  * Son of a merchant
  * Semi-rural Germany
  * father wanted him to be a lawyer
  * Consumed by fear of hell, that nothing he could do was enough to bring him to heaven.   
      - So, decided to become a monk (Augustinian)
      - continued to seek harsher penitence, etc. Did mass, collapsed

<h4>Augustine of Hippo</h4>

  * "City of God"
  * Battle against Pelagius: emphasis of grace in Augustine's soteriology (which means doctrine of salvation)
  * Augustine: only grace of god can provide salvation, not your actions in life
  * 1506: Augustine's "Opera Omnia"
      - Luther liked this
      - Inherited the salvation question from Augustine

<h4>Indulgences</h4>

  * In Catholic doctrine, you go to heaven, hell, and purgatory
  * Purgatory "invented" in 1215, as a sort of prison, keeps soul until sins are paid off
  * Indulgences: people on earth could ease the time in purgatory for ancestors/dead people you want to help
  * started as favors to peeps in ur life, but later became payments
      - starts with St Peter's cathedral
      - sent Johann Tetzel to sell indulgences, like any old merchant

<h4>95 Theses</h4>

  * October 1517: 95 Theses in Wittemberg
  * Some monks threw it away, but others took it to a printing press first and many pamphlets were distributed round town

>Summary: Reformation started around a question of corruption,. the 95 theses were only successful bc of the printing press. Lot of theological discussion as well. Luther didn't want to invent a new theology, but rather to return to the old one.

<h3>Luther's Theology</h3>

<h4>Main elements:</h4>

  * direct relationship with God
  * Sacramental doctrine
  * "Sola Scriptura"
      - by scripture alone
  * "Sola Fide"
      - by faith alone
  * "The Freedom of the Christian Man"
      - On the one hand, humasn are free from the Church: they do not need middlemen, talk directly to God
      - On the other hand, humans are left alone without the Church, and now there is nobody that can negotiate with God for you
  * Sacramental Doctrine:
      - 2 sacraments left: Baptism and Eucharist
          + only ones in the bible
      - Baptism stays the same
      - Eucharist changes
          + doctrine of consubstantiation (this means you do not need a priest to transform the bread into the body of Christ)
  * Sola Scriptura
      - Luther's new testament: translated Erasmus's into German
      - published in 1522
      - Implications of translating out of Latin
          + vernacular translation means no middleman necessary (no one to explain to you either). Must read it on ur own
  * Sola Fide
      - faith alone
      - no faith & good works

<h3>Politics</h3>

<h4>Not nec. orig</h4>

  * Many of the points he made were prev. made by Wycliff, Hus, even Erasmus anf St. Francis
  * They criticized from the inside, like Luther did at first, but later on Luther went outside of the Church and dismissed their importance
  * But that alone was not enough
  * POLITICS allowed his movement to come to fruition

<h4>Charles V an the Catholic Empire</h4>

  * Inherits Burgundy, Spain and Southern Italy, and the Holy Roman empire
  *
