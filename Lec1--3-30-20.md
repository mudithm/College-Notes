<h5>Philosophy of Science</h5>

  * `Philosophy: ` Love of wisdom
      - Stepping back from what we're doing, examining what one is doing and how one can do it better
  * Why examine science?
      - `Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)` 
      - What would amaze Kant if he was brought forward in time
          + `Phlogiston:` what Kant thought was the reason for combustion
              * items that burned contained phlogiston, and as they burn, they give off phlogiston
          + `Caloric:` substance that Kant thought heat transfer was caused by
              * Caloric flows between hotter materials to lower ones
          + `Newtonian:` Newton thought that the force of gravity is given by a certain equation
              * Now we have General Relativity + Quantum Mechanics

<h5>The Nature of the Course</h5>

This course will be a survey of view on the philosophy of science that will, initially, at least, follow a certain historical progression of views. Among the questions we will attempt to answer are the following: What is the difference between science and "metaphysics"? What is the difference between a science and a "pseudo-science"? Can scientific theories be shown to be true  or can they only be shown to be false? Can they even be shown to be false? What does it even mean to show a theory to be true or, on the contrary, to show it to be false? Are there interesting historical stages in the progression of a science, like chemistry? Do scientific theories get overthrown in something that one might call a "scientific revolution" or is there gradual accumulation of knowledge? Is there an algorithm that a computer could run which would pick out what theory it is best to believe given a set of evidence? What are the rules for doing science well? Are there any at all? What, if anything, warrants us in believing what our scientific theories tell us about the unobservable? What is it to provide a scientific explanation of some phenomenon? How should one update the profitability on attaches to a theory as new evidence comes in?
