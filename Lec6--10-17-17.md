<h5>Basics in BioChemitsy</h5>

<h6>Life on Earth is carbon based</h6>

_What is so important about Carbon?_
    Stuff about Carbon

<h6>Important Molecules of Life</h6>

1. Carbohydrates
2. Proteins
3. Lipids
4. Nucleic Acids

  * Store genetic Data

__ATP:__ the battery of life
  
  * has 3 phosphate groups
  * One phosphate group is removed when energy is used.
  * Thousands are used every second.

<h6>Life gains energy via electron transfer: REDOX reactions</h6>

Sausage us the electron donor (oxidixed to CO2)

<h6>The diersity of metabolic processes of life</h6>

| --- |Photo-autotrophic | Chemo-autotrophic | Photo-heterotrophic | Chemo-heterotrophic | --- |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|carbon source| co2 | co2 | organic compounds | organic compounds | 
|energy source| inorganic chemicals |

<h6>The key to metabolisms: Enzymes</h6>


<h6>Three domains of Life</h6>
1. Prokarya
  * Bacteria
  * Archaea
2. Eukarya
  * Plants, fungi, animals, etc.

__Eukaryotes__: cells contain a nucleus with genetic material within membranes
__Prokaryotes__: no membrane around genetic material, i.e. no nucleus

<h6>Single Cells vs Multicellular lifeforms</h6>

1. Single Cells:
  * Prokaryotes
      - bacteria, etc
  * Eukaryotes
      - Amoeba
      - Paramecium
      - Euglena

<h5>When and how did life evolve on Earth</h5>

1. Primordial Soup: oceans were filled with basic molecules that could form the biomolecules necessary for life as we know it
2. On the geologic time scale, evidence suggests that prokaryote life originated around 3.5 billi years ago.
3. Eukaryotes developed around 2 billi years ago.
4. Multicellular life much more recently.

<h3>Time Scales</h3>

<h6>Before Life--The Hadean</h6>

  * from Greek Hades
  * 4.6 - 3.8 billi years ago
  * formation of rock, oceans. and anoxic atmosphere
  * water possibly originate from degassing hydrated minerals of the high mantle

 <h6>Rise of Life--The Achaean</h6> 

   * from Greek origin
   * 3.8-2.5 billi yrs ago
   * formation of small continents not before the end of Archaean
   * Reduced atmosphere, water, temperature lower tan today (sun was weaker)

<h6>Models of Life Development</h6>

Current Models:

_Origin of Organic Molecules:_

  * Miller-Urey experiment: formation of organic molecules
  * Introduction of Organic molecules through meteoroid impacts
  * surdae reactions

_From organic molecules to protocells:_

  * Genes First: the RNA world
  * Metaboism First: surface metabolism
  * Lipids First: the lipid world

<h5>The primordial soup: Abiogenesis</h5>

  * an ocean that contained organic molecules from which life could have been formed
  * The origin of these molecules is unclear but some studies suggest that either electrical discharge or meteoroids brought the first organicc molecules

<h6>The Archaean Atmosphere</h6>

  * Atmos was enriched in methane, ammonia, carbon oxies, water vapor, nitrous oxides, hydrogen sulfide, and other noxious gases.
  * Very little or no oxygen.

<h6>Miller Urey Experiment</h6>

  * gases like that of the early earth and water in a glass container
  * heated it up and applied electrical discharge
      - the very simple molecules that were in the atmosphere produced very simple organic compounds
  * Setup was reproduced in 2008 confirmed that these molecules were produced, and found even more afterwards

<h6>Organic molecules from outer space during large heavy bombardment</h6>

  * period of heavy bombardment
  * may have contianed organic molecules that then became the stepping stool for the formation of life.
  * estimated to be 10^11-10^12 kg of organic compounds during the bombardment period.
  * It is possible that some material at the core of these meteoroids might have survived and landed in the ocean.

_Another theory: perhaps the energy from the impacts of meteoroids may have been the impoetus to allow for the formation of organic molecules._

<h6>Surface Reactions</h6>

Reactions with iron sulfides in volcanic regions and hydrothermal vents might have combined amino acids to form peptides.

<h5>From Organic Molecules to protocells</h5>

There must be a cell or some container containing all the necessary materials for life in order for life to form

DNA, RNA, and Proteins

__Theories about the RNA world__

  * prior to DNA, the genetic code was held in RNA
  * Maybe at one stage life ws a few self-replicating RNA molecules
  * the RNA world is proposed to have evolved into the DNA and protein world of today.
  * DNA, through its greater chemical stability, took over the role of data storage.
  * Protein, which is more glecible in catalysis through the great variety og amino acids, took over the metabolic processes RNA carried out.

__Theories about Surface Metabolism__

_Metabolism:_ a cucle of chemical reactions that produce energy in a form that can be harnessed by other processes.

_Reactions in the iron-sulfur world_

  * Produce Acetic acid and other organic acids and stuff

__Theories about the Lipid world__

Some kind of container was necessary for life to form in a stable manner

  * may have an inheritable potential, like proteins and RNA, have substantial catalytic capcacities

<h6>RNA world vs Lipid World</h6>

Segre and Lancet 2000

Genetic material surrounded by a semi-permeable membrane

>Alternative container made of Iron-Sulfides
>>small pockets in metal sulfides could have been the places where life developed
>>Lipids somehow coated the walls of these pockets, and some broke, leading to the first cell being released into the ocean.

Bacteria has a ester linkage in its fatty acid chains, and archaea have an ether linkage with isoprenoid chains.

The differences in their membranes might be explained by their formation in different pockets in the iron sulfide pocket chambers.
