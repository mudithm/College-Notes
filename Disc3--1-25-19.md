<h1>Discussion 3</h1>

---

<h4>Lab 1B</h4>

  * Add option to open with `O_RDWR` 
      - These are the three mandatory ones
  * `--pipe` option
      - create a pipe
  * `--wait`, which will wait for all commands to finish
      - each process will return its comamnd with exit status and specific formatting
  * `--close N` 
      - Once you close something, you need to ensure that an error occurs if you try to access it again
  * `--abort` 
      - cause the shell to cause, w a segmentation fault
  * `--catch N`  
      - output a diagnostic from N to standard error. (signal handling, N will be a decimal integer representing signal)
  * `--ignore`  
      - can be specified by the signal function `signal(name, SIG_IGN)`
  * `--default` 
      - can be specified byt he singal function `signal(name, SIG_DFL)` 
  * `--pause` 
      - `signal.pause()`

<h4>Lab 1C</h4>

  * `--profile` 
      - it will return a bunch of stats about what happened when the conmmand sequence occurs
      - `getrusage` 
          + Key Point:
              * `struct rusage`
              * contains user/system time
              * max resident set size
                  - `RSS` -- portion of program held in memory, if it is held in main memory
                  - shared memory/stack size
              * page reclaims/faults
              * swaps
              * block i/o operations
              * Messages sent/received
              * context switches (voluntary and involuntary)
      - `int getrusage(int who, struct rusage *r_usage)`
          + who:
              * `RUSAGE_SELF` the parent process that calls the function
              * `RUSAGE_CHILDREN` the child processes of the current process
          + exit codes: 0 on success, -1 on failure

```c
int who=RUSAGE_SELF;
struct rusage usage;
int ret;
ret = getrusage(who, &usage);
```

To get time in bash/dash benchmarks:

times (user/system times)
run benchmarks 3 times in each bash, dash, and simpsh
