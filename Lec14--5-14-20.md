<h3>Recap</h3> 

  * Deterministic PDA
  * L<sub>2</sub>: {0<sup>n</sup>1<sup>n</sup>}
  * L<sub>3</sub>: {0<sup>n</sup>1<sup>2n</sup>}
    - These two languages are both representable by an "unambiguous" context-free grammar
      + "unambiguous": not inherently ambiguous
  * L<sub>4</sub>: {a<sup>i</sup>b<sup>j</sup>c<sub>k</sub> | i=j OR i=k}
    - This can be represented by a CFL, but not a deterministic CFL
    - It is inherently ambiguous
      + It can be proven that every grammar in this language generates an infinite number of strings ambiguously  
        * when i = j = k
  * L<sub>5</sub>: {0<sup>i</sup>1<sup>j</sup> | j = i or j = 2i}
    - This is the union of L<sub>2</sub> and L<sub>3</sub>
    - This is not a DCFL
    - This is unambiguous
    - This happpens to be a disjoint union aside for &epsilon;, but it doesn't tell us anything about whether the union will be ambig, etc.
  * L<sub>6</sub>: {0<sup>n</sup>1<sup>n</sup>0} &xcup; {0<sup>n</sup>1<sup>2n</sup>00}
    - Also unambiguous, but not recognizeable by a DCFL
    - This is the closest on this page to human language
    - But, L<sub>6</sub><sup>R</sup> *can* be recognized by a DCFL.
      + Deterministic CFL are closed under complementation

<h3>Ambiguity in English</h3>

  * John and Mary went to the mall.
    - seems pretty clear
  * John and Mary went to the mall and the grocery store.
  * John and Mary went to the mall, and the grocery store was closed.
  * Adding words changes both the meaning and the structure of the sentence

<h3>Reductions</h3> 

  * Reductions in CF grammar are essentially derivations in reverse
  * __F14.1__
  * This is like a rightmost derivation in reverse -- this is also a leftmost reduction
  * Reduction symbol: &rarrtl;

<h3>Formal Def</h3>

  * Sentential form: string of variables and terminals (V &xcup; &Sigma;)*
  * U = xhy 
  * V = xTy
    - x, h, and y are all sentential forms; T is a variable
  * G contains a rule T &rarr; h
    - Then u &rarrtl; v using the rule T &rarr; h to replace "reducing string" h

<h3>Another example</h3>

  * __F14.2__
  * For any given leftmost reduction, there will be exactly one parse tree and rightmost derivation
  * There are two different leftmost reductions
  * you're allowed to ignore a _potential_ reducing string to the left so long as you never use that string in another reduction
    - In this case, we ignore the left SS to reduce the right SS
    - This is at the heart of the deterministic context-free grammars
