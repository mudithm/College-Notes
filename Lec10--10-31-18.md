<h4>Basic Data Types</h4>

  * `int`
      - holds integer elements
      - usually 4 bytes
  * `float` 
      - Holds floating point numbers
      - usually 4 bytes
  * `double` 
      - Holds higher-precision floating point numbers
      - Usually 4 bytes (double the size of a float)
  * `char` 
      - Holds a byte of data, characters
  * `void` 
      - `void` is a type of typelessness
      - In C, used when you don't want to dictate a type
      - kind of like the parent class of all
      - Often used for void pointers, where you dont know what type you want to point to

> There was no `bool` before C99. For robustness, you can use integers or chars in their place

<h4>Pointers</h4>

  * Variables that store memory addresses
  * Declaration:
      - `<variable_type> *<name>;` 
      - `int *ptr;        // declares an integer pointer` 
      - `int var = 77;    // declares an integer variable` 
      - `ptr = &var;      // assigns ptr to the address of var` 

<h4>Dereferencing pointers</h4>

  * Accessing the value that the pointer points to
  * `*ptr = 77;` assigns the value 77 to the memory address contained in the pointer
  * `printf("%d", *ptr);` prints out the value stored at the memory address contained in the pointer
  * Pointers to pointers are also chill.

<h4>Pointers to Functions</h4>

  * AKA function pointers, functors
  * Declarations:
      - Declare a function: `double (*func_ptr)(double, double);` 
      - Assign the functor to the function `pow`:
          + `func_ptr = [&]pow;` 

An example with `qsort`

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// This function takes void pointers and treats them as integer pointers.
// This allow you to use pointers of any type in the function, and have
// them be interpreted as ints.

int compare (const void * a, const void * b)
{
    return ( *(int*)a - *(int*)b) );
}


int main()
{
    int values[] = { 40, 10, 100, 90, 20, 25 };
    qsort (values, 6 sizeof(int), compare);
    int n;
    for (n = 0; n < 6; n++)
        printf("%d", values[n]);
    return 0;
}
```

This functionalisy allows you to use different sorting functions with the same sorting algorithm. This allows you to use the same algorithm to sort in ascending order, descending order, or any other order.

Distinguishing characteristic of a function:

  * Return type
  * Parameters
  * memory address

<h4>Structs</h4>

  * Used to package related data
  * Cannot have member functions
  * No access specifiers
  * No defined constructors

---

<h4>Dynamic Memory</h4>

  * Memory allocataed at runtime
  * Allocated on the heap
  * `void *malloc (size_t size);` 
      - allocates _size_ bytes and returns a pointer to the allocated memory
  * `void *realloc (void *ptr, size_t size);` 
      - Changes the size of a memory block pointed to by _ptr_ to _size_ bytes
  * `void free (void *ptr);` 
      - Frees the block of memory pointed to by _ptr_
