>What is the stance of Trump on Military service?
>>Checks twitter and other social media to try to answer this question

Congress Voting and Roll Call Data can be used to predict the outcomes of certain votes.

Legislative Voting Network



Voters | Bills | Words 
---|---|---
Ron Paul | H_CON_RES_185 | Combat



__Existing Work__

Mostly by Political Science, recently by computer science.

>It is difficult for pure Political Scientists to analyze large datasets of text, because they do not have the requisite tech.

Trends can be analyzed to find the best time to hold a vote with the desired outcome.

More than 95% Accuracy
Que Guau



To analyze twitter data, links wree analyzed for various normies, celebs, and politicians. It was then split into categories of follows, mentions, and retweets.

The most signigificant kind of link was the follow. [local](/home/mudith/Downloads/Sun_CS_2017_Ideology.pptx)

The follow link can help decide the true ideology of the user.


To get viable data, we start with a small subset of politicians, and choose the users who frequently interact with them from their followers/followees. Memers are excluded to the best of their ability.

They are in turn split into more politically involved and less politically involved individuals.



<h3>Validation</h3>

Comparing the binary classification with actual titles from other sources shows a 98 % accuracy in classifying political ideology (left or right).

They can also do link prediction to use an inferred ideology to predict the probability that you will retweet someone.

It is also p accurate.
