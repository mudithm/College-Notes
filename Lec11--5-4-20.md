<h3>Paul Feyerabend (1924 - 1994)</h3>

  * His main influences were Popper and Kuhn
  * His most famous work is the book Against Method, in which he argues that the method of science is "anything goes"
  * "Epistemological Anarchism": There are no rules of rational inquiry in science. Science requires creativity and rules would only constrain creativity

<h3>Where is creativity requires in science?</h3>

  * Is it required everywhere?
  * A distinction
      - The context of discovery: a historical episode in which one is trying to discover a new theory
      - The context of justification: a historical episode in which one is trying to justify a theory to be true or false
          + this might not require as much "creativity" as in the context of discovery
  * It is unclear that Feyerabend, himself, believed the views that are attributed to him since he claimed they did not represent his "deepest convictions." he might have seen his own role as a sort of "philosophical gadfly" charged with questioning the status quo
  * Godfrey-Smith suggests that Feyerabend holds the view (associated with the playwright Oscar Wilde) that aesthetic evaluation is the most important sort of evaluation of an idea
  * Either 1) one does not need to assess the truth of an idea to know that it is important, or 2) the beauty of an idea is a sign of truth

<h3>How could beauty be a sign of truth? isn't it just in the eye of the beholder?</h3>

  * Aristotle: "The chief forms of beauty are order and symmetry and definiteness, which the mathematical sciences demonstrate in a special degree." (Metaphysics, 1078a36)
  * Noether's Theorem (due to Emmy Noether [1882-1935])
      - Symmetries of physical systems imply conserved quantities
      - A standard example is that "time translation invariance" (roughly that the interactions in a system do not depend upon time) implies the conservation of energy
      - Finding that a candidate law of physics has that symmetry is a sign that it gets something right since energy really is conserved

<h3>Feyerabend on Science</h3>

  * Feyerabend saw science as a fundamentally human endeavor. It had once been liberating from certain dogmatic presumptions (like that the Earth is at the center). Now, it had become a new dogma from which people needed to be liberated
  * Feyerabend thought that Kuhn's views gave one a justification for excluding unorthodox views
  * Feyerabend also thought that in every period there are individuals questioning the dominant period
  * Science is sometimes dogmatic in its observational claims
  * It seems to be a fact accessible directly to observation that the Earth does not move. If so, an empiricist view should hold that the Earth does not move
  * In arguing for the Copernican Theory, Galileo had to show that this was not so

<h3>Feyerabend and Reason</h3>

  * These thoughts about Galileo lead Feyerabend to claim that one is best advised to be inclined against reason, since for all we know science may benefit from that
  * I would think that it is dubious to describe even this episode as being one in which Galileo is inclined against reason. Why not, instead, describe it as one in which Galileo showed it was not against reason and sense experience to think that the Earth moves?
  * Even if one thinks it is appropriate to describe Galileo as being inclined against reason, Godfrey-Smith notes that just because a policy failed once does not mean one should always go against the policy.

<h3>Methodological Rules in Feyerabend</h3>

  * The "Principle of Tenacity": hold on to theories even when they seem to have problems, for, if one does not, they will not develop to their maximum potential
  * The "Principle of Proliferation": As much as possible, explore new ideas, even ones that seem absurd. One should increase the "marketplace of ideas".
