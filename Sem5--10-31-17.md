<h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>

<h5>The Turing Test</h5>

  * Alan Turing 1950 as an operational test of intelligence, to fool a human interrogator into believing the agent is a human. To do this, one needs:
      - Natural Language Processing
      - Etc...

  * Alternatives: Pass a science test at an 8th grade level

<h6>Components of an integrated AI system</h6>

  * Perception
      - Speech
      - Vision
      - Touch 
      - Etc
  * Action
      - Written language
      - Speech
      - Etc

<h6>Knowledge Representation</h6>

  * Factual (facts) and Uncertain (beliefs) knowledge
  * Most of our knowledge is uncertain (what we think/assume to be true)
      - eg my car is in the parking lot, my home is not on fire.
  * How do we acquire knowledge?
      - experts
      - by conversion from other forms of knowledge
      - by learning from data

_First Order Logic_
  * A Quizzle like problem can be solved by algorithms.

  * Baliefs
      - Belief Networks

<h5>Reasoning</h5>

  * Deduction: What follows from a knowledge base
  * Belief Revision: Which beliefs to give up in case of a contradiction
  * Causality: What is the cause of an event?

How can we reason efficiently?
  * Time
  * Space
  * Footprint

<h6>Explainable AI</h6>

<h5>Natural Language</h5>

  * Understanding Language Understanding
  * Generate natural language
  * Text Summarization
  * Machine Translation
  * Speech Transcription 

  * Why is it so hard?
      - Syntactic Ambiguity
      - Semantic Ambiguity
      - Pragmatic Ambiguity

  * Two key approaches:
      1. Classical: Provide system with rich information about the world, perform thorough syntactic analysis, disambiguate using knowledge and reasoning.
      2. Modern: Rely on corpus and disambiguate using machine learning (applicability in specicfic contexts)
