1. Libraries are additional code that can be used by the program to perform added functionality.
    * Input and Output is not part of the OG language -- it is contained in a _library._
    
    * The standard library for CS contains the IO and many other things in the language.
    
    * To include an element from a library, you use the  _#include_ keyword.
    
    * ambiguities between libraries are always caught during compilation,
    
    * The namespace "std" contains the names for the various variables and keywords in the standard library.

__Declaration:__
> type identifier;
> or
> type identifier = ...;
>  
> An identifier has to start with a letter, followed by 0 or more letters, digits, or underscores.
> 
> No spaces are allowed in an identifer.

>Conventions dictate that:

>> words are seperated by either underscores (two_words), capitalization (HelloWorld or helloWorld), or some other clear delineation.

>> variable names have some siginificance that makes it easier for collaborators to understand

>> Variables are not declared until they are to be used.

__*Arithmetic Expressions*__

Follows the classic order of operations of mathematics

Multiplication must always be explicitly represented by __*__.

When different types are involved, the more precise of the types will be the result  

EG 

>int / double is double
>double / double is double

__BUT__

>int / int results in an int (dropping the fraction)

>14/5 = 2
>14.0/5 = 2.86

Operations will retain the type of their component parts
eg 

    double x = 3.1 + 14/5 
             = 3.1 + 2 
             = 5.1

>*No matter the type of the variable to which they are assigned.*

---

To change the precision of output:

    cout.setf(ios::fixed); //sets it to fixed notation rather than scientific
    cout.precision(2); // sets it to 2 decimal places

>This doesn't change the value of the variable, just the precision of the output.
