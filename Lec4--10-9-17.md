    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;

    int main(){
        double hoursWorked; // anywhere from 10^-308 to 10^308  15 or 16 sig digs
        double payRate;

        //ints can hold numbers from -2 billi to 2 billi

        //cout: standard output destination
        cout << "How many hours did you work?  ";
             
                /*std::cout << "this is another way to output, using the
                standard syntax to avoid library ambiguities.";  */
        
        cin >> hoursWorked;


        cout >> "What is your hourly rate of pay?  ";
        cin >> payRate;

        cout << "You earned $" << (hoursWorked * payRate) << "." << endl;

1. Libraries are additional code that can be used by the program to perform added functionality.
    * Input and Output is not part of the OG language -- it is contained in a _library._
    
    * The standard library for CS contains the IO and many other things in the language.
    
    * To include an element from a library, you use the  _#include_ keyword.
    
    * ambiguities between libraries are always caught during compilation,
    
    * The namespace "std" contains the names for the various variables and keywords in the standard library.

__Declaration:__
> type identifier;
>  
> An identifier has to start with a letter, followed by 0 or more letters, digits, or underscores.
> 
> No spaces are allowed in an identifer.

>Conventions dictate that:

>> words are seperated by either underscores (two_words), capitalization (HelloWorld or helloWorld), or some other clear delineation.

>> variable names have some siginificance that makes it easier for collaborators to understand
