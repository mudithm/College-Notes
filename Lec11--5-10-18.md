<h4>From last time...</h4>

  * Humanism and Renaissance
      - Intellectual, not pop-culture movement
      - patrons and artisans, luxury goods increased
      - movement itself was mainly confined to the upper class, artisans, etc
  * Importance of antiquity
  * importance of Christianity
      - philology, etc
  * Importance of the sense of history and of the place of humans in history
      - not individualism
      - those who pursued intellectualism and were male were "human," and others were not

<h4>American Exploration 101</h4>

  * Motive
      - Spices and silk
      - Traditionally went to the east to get this shibb
      - after Constantinople falls in 1453, there was no route to the east without going through Muslim territory (not an easy thing to do)
      - decided to go west
  * Means
      - Triangular sails for increased speed and agility
      - Better maps

<h4>Race across the Ocean</h4>

  * The first to go across the Ocean were the Portuguese
  * went from Africa to India in early 15th century
  * Then came Spain
      - put a shibbload of resources into colonization

<h4>Castile and Aragon become "Spain"</h4>

  * Ferdinand and Isabella marry and unite
  * Kept separate titles and ruled their respective countries separately
  * Religion was what ensured Spain's uniformity
  * Also in 1492: 
      - Expulsion of the Jews
      - End of the Reconquista
  * Competition with Portugal
  * Competition with the Muslim territories

<h4>Christopher Columbus</h4>

  * Meanie

<h4>Source</h4>

  * orientalism:
      - inability to see new places as valuable/beautiful by their own right
      - everything was seen through the lens of what would be good for Europe
          + slaves/labor, spices, gold, territory, etc
  * patriotism + providentialism (like Joan of Arc)

<h4>Backlash against these memes</h4>

  * Las Casas
      - denounced Spanish atrocities
      - Still thought they should be brought into Christianity
  * Francisco de Vitoria
      - How the conquered "changed" the conquerors
      - international law
  * Aquinas and the concept of "just war"
      - Just Cause
      - Legitimate authority which decides to go to war
      - just intention for going to war
      - just way of waging war
  * Vitoria again:
      - Waging war against the Natives is wrong bc
          + NO right reason: Christianity must not be forced
          + NO legitimate authority: the government of the Natives is as legitimate as the one of Spain
          + So is the war completely wrong?
              * de facto argument
              * in theory, they shouldn't, but since they already are, might as well

<h4>Why do we care?</h4>

  * las casas and vitoria: two sides of the same coin
  * Casas didn't consider that not being Christian was a valid option
      - Method of conversion, not conversion itself
  * Vitoria
      - what is Government after all? does it need to be Christian to be legitimate?

<h4>Orientalism and the New World</h4>

  * A way of studying the colonies, apply to the Indigenous
  * Columbus: the indians are the makings of the Other
  * Casas: Let us not kill them, because they are the other
  * Both dehumanize them
  * Vitoria: they are just like us
