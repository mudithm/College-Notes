`CALLQ` leaves a data instruction that tells where to retur
It performs a jump and it pushes onto the stack.

`RET` is an indirect meme, and the push and pop tells it where to jump.

<h4>Stack and Heap</h4>

  * Stack grows downwards
      - incrementing stack means lower on stack
      - decrementing means higher on stack
  * Heap grows upwards
      - contains dynamically allocated memory (from malloc, etc)
      - incrementing means higher in heap
      - decrementing means lower in heap

<h4>Popping and Pushing the stack</h4>

  * `%RSP` is the stack pointer, that points to the top of the stack
      - this is the lowest address on the stack
  * To push,
      - `decr` %rsp (ie by 8)
      - `mov`
  * To pop,
      - `mov` whatever is at %rsp to somewhere else
      - `incr` %rsp (ie by 8)

<h4>Procedure data flow</h4>
 
  * Up to the first 6 arguments of a function will be stored in registers for faster access
  * the rest will be put on the stack in reverse order
  * %rbp used to be used to keep track of the top-most location (highest address) of a frame. This kept track of a program's scope. (used in I32)
  * Callee safe: the caller knows that the callee has the responsibility to save this value
  * caller safe: the caller has the responsibility to save the values
      - Ex: %rax as the return pointer
      - u might hav to save its value elsewhere before you call another function with a return value
  * `objdump -e programname` gives assembly dump
  *
