<h5>DNS: 4 major parts</h5>

1. Defines a hierarchical name space
2. Creates a distributed (federate) database, implemented through a hierarchy of authoritative servers (servers are set up and owned by the owner of the name. You are obligated to provide multiple servers that can answer queries to your names)
3. Local DNS servers (also called caching resolver) to look up the database
4. Local DNS servers query authoritative servers using DNS query protocol

<h5>DNS Namespace</h5>

  * TLD: Top level domains
      - ccTLD: us, uk, fr (country code)
      - gTLD: edu, com, gov, org (generic)
      - Also, there is a special address (in-addr.arpa) to look up inet addresses (ie ip address)
          + This can be used to do address to name translation
          + you need to reverse the order sort of   
              * ie looking up 192.168.1.1 is 1.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa
  * Next level:
      - ucla, xerox, Dell, acm, etc
  * Example: upe.seas.ucla.edu

| Root | TLD | lower levels | ... | ... |
| ---- | --- | ------------- | --- | --- |
| ---- | edu |  ucla   | seas | upe |

  * Starting from the root, growing downward
      - variable depth
  * each non-leaf node in the tree is a domain
      - each domain belongs to an administrative authority
      - a comain can set up its own subdomains, no limit on the tree depth
  * DNS name hierarchy: independent from internet's topological connectivity

<h5>DNS Namespace governance</h5>

  * ICANN oversees management of    
      - assignmetn of TLD's
      - Delegation of TLD managements
      - Operation of the root Name Servers

<h5>Namespace allocation</h5>

  * Root allocates com., org., edu.
  * Zones are domains that run their own authoritative servers

<h5>A special TLD: in-addr.arpa</h5>

  * provides IP address to DNS name lookup
      - to get DNS name for address 2.3.4.5, querey for 5.4.3.2.in-addr.arpa
  * Why useful: helps with something like a traceroute
  * Reverse DNS lookup is commonly used today as a weak security checking (eg by email servers)

<h5>DNS Name servers</h5>

  * Authoritative servers
      - serving quesries for a given zone
          + each zone must provide multiple authoritative name server
          + master -- maintaining the master file
          + slave -- repliacated copes of the master file
  * Caching Resolvers (the book called "local DNS servers")
      - query authoritative servers on users behalf
      - cache the data from replies
  * Stub resolvers
      - inside user hosts
          + configured with IP address of caching resolver(s)
          + send application DNS queries to caching resolver

<h5>Verisign</h5>

  * the registry for .com
  * ICANN delegates the management of .com to verisign
  * Verisign contracts registrars to sell domain names to the puvlic
      - example registrars
          + GoDaddy (US)
          + 22net (in China)
          + CoolOcean (India)
      - there exist a *very* large number of registrars.
  * Verisign operates *authoritative name* servers for .com TLD domain
