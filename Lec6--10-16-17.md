__Magic Numbers__:  A number that might change if requirements change. OR any number whose meaning is not immediately clear (e.g. any number that is not 0 or 1).

Magic numbers should be initialized at the top of the program and be written with capital letters.

1. including the keyword `const` in a variable dectaration ensures that its value cannot be changed throughout the course of the program.

2. Comments and whitespace can be used to separate the parts of the function that perform distinct actions

3. Improving the readabliity of your programs not only helps others understand your code, but also makes it easier for you to read and understand your own code in the future.

<h6>Common Control Structure Issues</h6>

    if (condition)
        statementIfTrue
    else
        statementIfFalse


An ambiguity:


    if (citizenship == "USA")
        if (age == 18)
            cout << "You can vote in US elections." << endl;
    else
        cout << "You are not a US citizen. "  << endl;

Which 'if' will the 'else' apply to?

In this case, the else will bind to the nearest preceding if statement without its own else.

So, in this case, the else would pair with the second if statement, which is incorrect.

To fix this,

    // Add curly braces to the if statement to clarify which if the else should bind to        
    if (age == 18){
            cout << "You can vote in US elections." << endl;
    } else
        cout << "You are not a U.S. citizen. " << endl;


Another issue:

    if (citizenship == "USA" || citizenship =  "Canada")
        ...
    if (citizenship == "USA" || == "Canada") // WRONG! Illegal Syntax
        ...
    if (citizenship == "USA" || "Canada") // WRONG! Dowsn't do what you want
        ...

info: a string is linked to a non-null pointer, which when placed into a boolean condition always returns true. So the last condition will always evaluate to true.

Similar rules apply to integer comparisons, etc. Each side of an or or and statement must be a full boolean conditional.


    if (citizenship == "USA" || citizenship == "Canada" && age >= 18)

&& has higher precedence than or.
So, the above statement is equivalent to  

    if (citizenship == "USA" || ( citizenship == "Canada" && age >= 18 ) )  

A better way to write this would be 

    if ((citizenship == "USA" || citizenship == "Canada") && age >= 18)


Another issue:



    int n = 17;
    cout << "n is " << n << endl;

    if (n = 0)
        cout << "n is 0" << endl;
    else
        cout << "n is not zero; n is " << n << endl;

Output:

    n is 17
    n is not zero; n is 0

What's the problem? We used the assignment operator `=` instead of the comparison operator `==`

To fix this:

    if (n == 0) // change the `=` to a `==`
        cout << "n is 0" << endl;
    else
        cout << "n is not zero; n is " << n << endl;

But why does the assignment operator compile in the conditional statement?

In C, `i = j = 17` assigns `17` to `j` and then `j` to `i`. So, the assignment also returns the value of the assigned value. This is a common issue in beginner programming.

<h6>De Morgan's Laws:</h6>

>not (A or B) ==> (not A) && (not B)
>not (A and B) ==> (not A) || (not B)

    if (condition1)
        doSomething();
    else if (condition2)
        doSomethingElse();
    else
        doAThirdThing();

The above structure is commonly referred to as an "if ladder"

It is also important to recognize that at any given point in the course of a program's execution, certain things must be true.

eg

    if (income < 30000)
        cout << "Low" << endl;
    else if (income < 100000)   
        cout << "Middle" << endl;
        
        /* Income be at least 30000 or the frst statement would 
        have evaluated as true  */

    int main(){

        ...
        int choice;
        cin >> choice;

        ...

        if (choice == 1)
        ...
        else if (choice == 2 || choice == 4)
        ...
        else if (choice == 3 || choice == 5)
        ...
        else{
            cout << "Invalid choice!" << endl;
            return 1;
        }
    }


The above is an example of bad error reporting practice. If I enter 7, the program does not tell me why my choice is invalid, or what good input would be. A better choice for the output would be:

    ...
    else{
        cout << "The choice must be 1 - 5." << endl;
        cout << "Goodbye." << endl;
        return 1;
    }
    

Or, if you are feeling fancy, you could use a switch statement.


    ...
    int choice;
    cin >> choice;

    ...

    switch (choice){
        case 1:
            ...
            break;
        case 2:
        case 4:
            ...
            break;
        case 3:
        case 5:
            ...
            break;
        default:
            cout << "Choice must be between 1 and 5. Goodbye" << endl;
    }

The variable in the switch statement must be an integer type. The test is for exact equality, so doubles don't work.

<h6>While Loop Example</h6>

    #include <iostream>

    using namespace std;

    int main(){

        cout << "How many times do you want to be greeted?  ";
        int nTimes;
        cin >> nTimes;

        int n = 0;

        while (n < nTimes){
            cout << Hello << endl;
            n++;
        }
    }

While loops: 

    ...
    while (condition)
        statement
    ...

Do-While loops:

    ...
    do {
        statement
    } while (condition)
    ...
