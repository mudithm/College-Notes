<h3>Recap</h3>

  * FSLs = {all languages accepted by a DFA}
  * FSLs = {all languages accepted by an NFA}
      - Both DFAs and NFAs are ways of representing patterns in some way
  * Regular Expressions = "pure pattern"
    - not in any way imperative -- don't tell you HOW to recognize a language, or what the strings in a language are, but are one way of representing the pattern of the strings in a language
      + All three of these representations are equivalent of eachother

<h3>Regular Expressions</h3>

  * R is a regular expression if R is
    - a for some a in the alphabet &Sigma;,
    - &epsilon;,
    - &empty; (empty language),
    - (R<sub>1</sub> &cup; R<sub>2</sub>), where R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> are regular expresions,
    - (R<sub>1</sub> &compfn; R<sub>2</sub>), where R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> are regular expresions, or
    - (R<sub>1</sub><sup>*</sup>), where R<sub>1</sub> is a regular expression

<h3>Recursive Definition over &Sigma;</h3>

| ... | Regular Expression -- Sequence of Math Symbols (Syntax) | Denotes -- The meaning of the symbols (Semantics) |
| --: | :-: | :-- | 
| Basis Cases: | | |
| 1. For all a &isin; &Sigma;, | a | {a} |
| 2.  | &epsilon; | {&epsilon;} |
| 3.  | &empty; | {} |
| Recursive Cases: | If R & S are Regular Expressions, | then so are: |
| 4.  | (R &cup; S) or (R + S) | (Set denoted by R) &cup; (Set denoted by S) |
| 5.  | (R &compfn; S) or (R &sdot; S) | (Set denoted by R) &compfn; (Set denoted by S) |
| 6.  | R<sup>x&amp;</sup> | (Set denoted by R)<sup>*</sup>|
