<h4>Sorting algorithms</h4>

  * Selection Sort
      - Best Case: O(N^2)
      - Avg Case: O(N^2)
      - Worst Case: 0(N^2)
  * Bubble Sort
      - Best Case: O(N)
      - Avg Case: O(N^2)
      - Worst Case: O(N^2)
  * Insertion Sort
      - Best Case: O(N)
      - Avg Case: O(N^2)
      - Worst Case: O(N^2)
  * Shell Sort
      - Avg Case: like O(N^1.5) ish
  * Merge Sort:
      - All Cases: O(Nlog(N))
      - works in a pretty cool way
  * Quick Sort:
      - works like the function we wrote to sort in Homework 3
      - O(N)
      - By Hoare
      - Pivot
  * Introsort:
      - Decides as it runs which algorithm to use
      - guaranteed worst-case nlogn behavior.
      - most common in language libraries.
