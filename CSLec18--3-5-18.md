<h4>Binary Search Tree</h4>

  * A binary search tree is either:
      - empty, or
      - a node with a left BST and a right BST such that
          + the value at every node in the left BST is <= the value at this node
          + the value at every node in the right BST is >= the value at this node
  * Binary searches through perfectly balanced binary search trees are O(log(N))
      - Noice
      - In the worst case for a binary search tree that still qualifies, one that is not very well balanced, the order becomes (O(N))

Binary Search Tree Algorithms:

```c++
void printBST(const Node* t)
{
    if (t == nullptr)
        return;
    printBST(t->leftNode);
    cout << t->data << endl;
    printBST(t->rightNode);
}

```

Another traversal structure:

inorder: process this node BETWEEN processing the left subtree and the right subtree

Only used for binary tree.


To remove a node from a binary subtree, you either replace it with the furthest right value of its left subtree or its furthest left value of its right subtree.

To preserve balance, randomly choose the right or left side to replace the current meme.
