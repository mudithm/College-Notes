<h6>Other Names of Astrobiology</h6>
  * Exobiology
      - Study of life on planets other than Earth
  * Exopaleontology
      - If the life in question is extince
  * Bioastronomy

<h6>Definition of Astrobiology</h6>

  * "Exobiology" coined by Nobel prize winner Joshia Lederberg
      - study of life beyond the Earth
      - called by some a "subject without subject matter"
      - Current targets of exobiological research include Mars, the satellites of Jupiter, and other solar systems

<h6>The fundamental questions of Astrobiology</h6>

  * How does life begin and evolve?
  * Does life exist elseqhere in the universe?
  * what is the future of life on Earth and beyond?

<h6>The Mantras of Astrobiology</h6>

**Follow the:**

  * Water (traditional)
  * Nitrogen (newer)
  * Energy (newer)

**Other Assumptions to Narrow the Task:**

  * Life is based on carbon chemistry
  * sun-like stars provide energy

 <h6>Follow the warer: the habitable zone</h6> 

   * The Habitable Zone (hz): a theoretical "shell" surrounding a star in which that planaet could have liquid water on its surface

<h6>Follow the Nitrogen</h6>

  * Nitrogen is easier to track than carbon because it is more easily identified in the atmospheres of planets.
  * Carbon that is related to life and its processes is a very small portion of the Earth's atmosphere. For identification purposes, it is then easier to search for Nitrogen.
  * Denitrigication: when organisms "breathe" nitrogen instead of oxygen, they produce nitrogen gas.

<h6>Follow the Energy</h6>

  * All life needs energy
  * Energy Requirements consist of:
      - A Power component (energy per unit time)
      - A Voltage component (energy delivered per unit event)
  * There are discrete minimum values for each component, beneath which we do not believe life as we know it is possible
  * On earth, the main structure associated with life energy is ATP

<h4>Interdisciplinary Research</h4>

<h6>1. Astronomy/Astrophysics</h6>

**The main goals of Astronomy/Astrophysics in Astrobiology:**
  
  * Detect Earth-sized planets 
  * Determine the basic composition of an extrasolar planet's atmosphere and/or surface

<h6>2. Biology</h6>

**The main targets of biological studies in Astrobiology are:**

  * Extreme environments
  * Origin of Life
  * Evolution of Life

 <h6>3. Astrogeology/Astrogeochemistry</h6> 

 **The main targets of geological/geochemical studies in Astrobiology are:**

   * Geology of the Celestial Bodies, including
       - Planets
       - Moons
       - Asteroids
       - Comets
       - Mereorites
   * Determine their potential to develop and sustain life
   * Geochemistry of Celestial bodies
       - study chemical processes and reactions
       - cycles of matter and energy, and their interaction with the hydrosphere/atmosphere
   * Fossil records of life from Early Earth

<h6>Alternative Biochemistry</h6>

**Alternative Biochemistry:** the speculative biochemistry of alien life forms that differ radically from those on Earth

<h5>What could be different from Earth life?</h5>


---

---



<h6>Chirality</h6>

  * In all known life on Earth
      - Amino acids in proteins are "left-handed" (L)
      - sugars are "right-handed" (D)
  * Molecules of Opposite Chirality
      - are mirrored versions
      - have identical chemical properties (most of the time)
  *  Extraterrestrial life could have D amino acids or L sugars

<h6>Alternates to Carbon</h6>

  * Humans are carbon based lifeforms, and all life on earth is the same.
  * Because of this, scientists often succumb to "carbon chauvinism"
      - excluding the posiibility of all other elements as a base for life
  * A possible alternative for Carbon is Silicon

<h6>Why Carbon?</h6>

  * Carbon can
      - Bond to itself
      - Form long chains
      - Form rings

<h6>Silicon Biochemistry</h6>

  * Has many similar chemical properties to Carbon
  * Is in the same periodic table group

<h6>Problems with Silicon</h6>

1. Molecule Size
  * Silicon atoms are much bigger
      - Larger mass
      - larger atomic radius
  * Because of this, they have trouble forming double or triple covalent bonds
  * Molecules that alternate Silicon and Oxygen (silicones), however, can be much more stable
  * These are still not as stable as their carbon alternatives

2. Silicon Dioxide (quartz)
  * Silicon Dioxide is the silicon analog to Carbon dioxide
      - non-soluble solid in water's liquid temperature range
      - difficult to be introduced into water-based biochemical systems
  * This would actually be the product of aerobic respiration
      - (life would "exhale" a solid)

<h6>Silicon vs Carbon</h6>

1. Of the varieties molecules identified in the interstellar medium, 84 are based on carbon and 8 are based on silicon
2. Four of those 8 also contain carbon
3. The cosmic abundance of silicon is 1/10th of carbon
4. Earth is silicon rich and carbon poor, but it still prefers carbon for life.
  * This might be an indication that silicon-based life is not well suited for life on earth-like planets
  * They could, however, be more useful in climates with much higher temperatures.

<h5>Non-green photosynthesizers</h5>

<h6>Pigment color depends on the light spectrum</h6>

  * Clorophyll appears green because it absorbs mainly blue and red light, while reflecting most of the green light
  * If the stars for other planets were in a different state than the sun,
      - light frequency distribution would be different, and
      - plants would evolve a different type of photosynthetic pigment

<h6>Different atmospheric composition</h6>

  * Atmospheric composition on Earth has changed significantly over time
  * Atmospheres on other planets could be relatively dense or sparse
  * Changes in the gas mixture impacts the biochemistry and morphology of life.

<h5>Non Water Solvents</h5>

<h6>Advantages of Water</h6>

  * Large liquid range (0-100C)
  * High Heat capacity 
      - useful for temperature regulation
  * Large heat of vaporization
  * Able to dissolve many substances
      - because of high polarity
  * less dense as a solid than a liquid

<h6>Liquid Ammonia as an alternative for water</h6>

**Advantages of liquid ammonia:**

  * Enables numerous chemical reactions
  * Dissolves most organic molecules at least as well as water does
  * Additionally, capable of dissolving many elemental metals

**Disadvantages of liquid ammonia:**

  * Only stable in *reduced environments*
  * hydrogen bonds between ammonium molecules are weaker than those in water
      - results in stronger vaporization
      - lower surface tension
  * Liquid at very low temperature
  * Does not dissolve many ions

<h5>Interstellar Dust-based Life</h5>

<h6>Life in Plasma?</h6>

  * 2007: V. N. Tsytovich and colleagues discovered he possibility of life-like behaviors being exhibited by dust particles suspended in plasma, similar to conditions in interstellar space
  * particles fould self-organize into mocroscopic helical structures capable of replicating themselves

**Xenobiology:** The xenobiologic lifeforms can be so exotic that we don;t know what and where to look for therefore this concept is not suitable for space probe and mission planning. Xenobiology describes a form of biology that is not (yet) familiar to science and is not found in nature.

<h5>Astrobiological study sites on Earth</h5>

<h6>Atacama Desert, Chile</h6>

  * dry, dusty, harch environment
  * life forms are not apparnet
  * Scientists use this site to test the sesnsitivity of instruments intended to search for life on Mars
  * Finding life in the Atacama would validate the technology
  * Also good for testing instruments for soil sampling and analysis

<h6>Testing a life detection instrument for Mars in the Atacama Desert, Chile</h6>

  * Dust and temperature extremes
  * 340 Tests were run with *Mars Organic Analyzer*
      - unambiguously able to detect amino acids
      - also able to detect handedness of amino acids
      - "homochirality" is a hallmark of lide hat could be a critical test that must be done on Mars

<h6>Baja, California</h6>

  * hypersaline ponds at a salt producing company
  * studying microbial mats
  * Also in nearby Ojo de Liebre
  * An entire biogeochemical cycle exists within these mats

<h6>Mponeng Gold Mine, near Johannesburg</h6>

  * isolated, self-sustaining bacterial community
  * two miles beneath surface
  * exclusively dependent on geologically produced sulfur and hydrogen
  * does not depend on energy from the sun in any way
