<h3>Database</h3>

  * RDBMS
      - Relational database management system
      - Structured collection of data
      - create, reda, update, and delete data (CRUD)


<h3>Data Models</h3> 

  * Conceptual tool that describes data elements and their relationship
  * Primary is Relational
  * Network Graph model is cool too
  * What is a relation?
  * Collection of relations is a table

<h3>Superkey</h3>

  * set of one or attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple in a table
  * A table may have many superkeys
  * The superkey with the fewest possible attributes is a "candidate key"
      - Primary key is the candidate key chosen by the DB designer
      - Composite primary keys (primary keys made of more than one col.)
      - The primary key should use attributes that never change (or change very rarely)

<h3>Foreign key</h3>

  * Create a relationship between two tables
  * foreign key
      - attribute that ties the tuples of two relations together into one
      - a foreign key in a relation r1 does not need to uniquely identify a tuple in r1 but does need to do so in the referred relation r2.
