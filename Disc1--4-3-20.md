<h3>Communication</h3>

  * OH
      - Wed 11:30-12:30
      - Thur 11:30-12:30
  * Math questions should be asked in Disc sections and office hours
      - help with problems, explanations, review, etc
  * CCLE Dashboard for clarifications, administrative questions, etc
  * email as a last resort

---

<h3>Why this course?</h3> 

  * Balance bt math and CS
  * kinda programming
  * Will show problems that cannot be solved by ANY computer
      - and prove it with rather simple tools
  * Will naturally build a model that is equivalent to computers
  * More fascinatinng results
  * Connections w/ programming, linguistics, philosophy, etc.

<h3>First Attempt -- Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)</h3>

  * __D1.0__
      - DFA -- Deterministic Finite Automaton
      - PDA -- Pushdown Automata
          + context-free grammars
      - TM -- Turing machine
          + This can do anything that any computer can do
      - ???
          + There are some languages that no computer can compute
  * __D1.1__
      - This is a finite state machine that accepts strings of even length
      - The delta function is the transition function, which must contain all transitions between states
          + Takes in a state and input, decides on the output state.

<h3>Fully specified DFA's</h3>

  * For a fully specified DFA, all states must have branches for ALL possible imputs (ie the entire alphabet)
  * There are infinite DFAs possible for each language, bc there can be infinite dummy/unreachable states that have loops, etc.

---

<h3>Simple Examples</h3> 

  * __D1.2__
      - Note -- when languages are different, they cannot have the same automaton (according to the TA)
      - Additionally, you must consume the next symbol in the string in order to transition in a DFA

<h3>Harder examples</h3>

  * __D1.3__
  * For 4, the first state is a "happy state," the second is an "alarm state," meaning that you are close to a failure state, and the third is the rejecting state.

<h3>Even harder</h3>

  * __D1.4__
  * The first one is ANY prefix -- meaning at any point, this must be true
      - if this constraint wasn't placed, then there wouldn't exist any finite DFA for this problem, since we would have to either have an infinite number of states or some memory (which DFA's cannot do)

<h3>General tips</h3>

  * Don't forget to indicate start, accepting states, and all transitions (for fully spec'd)
  * Check the automaton on simple words
      - Check on empty string, len 0, len 1, etc
  * use a reject state if needed
  * Combine DFAs patterns together
      - {w|w starts with 1 and ends with 0}
