<h3>W. V. O. Quine</h3>

  * Holism About Testability
      - Individual statements do not have implications as to what one will observe
      - F=ma doesn't predict that something will fall when you drop it on Earth
      - it takes a large body of statements to yield what you will observe
  * Ex:
      - If there is a tree in front of me, then I will see a tree
          + P &rarr; O
          + Not necessarily, what if your eyes are open?
      - If there is a tree in front of me and my eyes are open, then I will see a tree
          + P, Q &rarr; O
          + not necessarily, what if it is dark?
      - If there is a tree in front of me and my eyes are open and there is some light, then I will see a tree
          + P, Q, R &rarr; O
          + might be obstructions
      - If there is a tree in front of me and my eyes are open and there is some light and nothing is blocking the tree from view, then I will see a tree
          + P, Q, R, S &rarr; O
          + still might not be true (ie blind)

<h3>Another example</h3>

  * If (P & Q & R & S) then O
  * Not O
  * ---------
  * Not (P & Q & R & S)
  * Deductive logic does not forcve me to give pu P -- nor does it forcve me to give up Q
      - We don't know which subsets of the premises is false, or if more info is required and they are all true
  * Quine claimed that I could continue to believe P "come what may."

<h3>Against the Verif Theory of Meaning</h3>

  * Quine thought that it assumed that individual sentences have implications for what one will observe via the senses
  * While it is true that "The nothing nothings" makes no prediciton on its own that on can use to verify it, that is true of "There is a tree in front of me" too
  * Along with other sentences, "The nothing nothings" might yield a prediction
      - ie, "If the nothing nothings, I will see a tree in front of me"
  * Quine thought that the notion that individual statements can be verified on their own is flawed

<h3>A problem for the Analytic/Synthetic distinction</h3>

  * Hallmarks of an analytic statement
      - Experiment cannot force you to give it up
      - Experminet cannot even suggest that it is false
  * Quine thought that every statement had the first property
  * He also thought that no statement had the second property
  * So, are there any truly analytic statements?
      - There are no a priori claims, even mathematics
