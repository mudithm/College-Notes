<h5>Defs and Terminology</h5>

peep the slides [here](https://www.sajaddarabi.com/cm146/cm146_week2.html#/)

How to get the number of possible functions in the hypothesis space -- number of possible outputs * (number of options per feature ^ number of features)

Use L1 for sparser data, use L2 for closer data

```python
class KNN:
    def train(self, x_train):
        self.x_train = x_train
```

KNN has constant training time

Prediction time: measuring the similarity between different examples (by distance of some type)

Look at bias and variance online
