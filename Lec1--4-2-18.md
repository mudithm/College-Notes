ISA (Depending on the system (eg x86, ARM, etc))

microarchitecture (dependent on the system)

<h3>Bits and Bytes</h3>

<h4>Everything is bits</h4>

  * m

<h4>Word-Oriented Memory Organization</h4>

  * Register(Part of CPU) and Memory(Separate)
  * Stored like a large array
  * In memory, it is like a byte-level organization
  * 32-Bit systems are limited to 2^32 Bytes of (virtual) mem, 64-bit to 2^6 Bytes
      - Usually limited by software
  * 32 bit "words" are 4 bytes in length, 64 bit are 8 bytes

|||
|---|---|
|8 bits| `0` |
|`01001011`| `1` |
|...| |

<h4>Boolean Algebra</h4>

  * `AND`, `OR`, and `XOR` are binary operators
  * `NOT` is a unary operator
  * Operations are performed bitwise

<h4>Shift Operations</h4>
  
  * Left Shift (x << 3)
      - Stuff is shifted x bits to the left and the rest is replaced by 0s
      - `10010101` -> `10101000`
  * Right Shift (x >> 3)
      - Depends on type of shift
      - Logical Shift
          + move right, fill with 0's on left
          + `10010101` -> `00010010`
      - Arithmetic shift
          + move left, fill with most significant on left
          + `10010101` -> `11110010`

<h4>Multiplication and division using bitwise operations</h4>

  * Multiplication involves arithmetic right shifts
  * division uses the floor function
  * To represent a negative number, take the complement of a number and add 1
  * `10010101` -> `01101011` 

<h4>Byte Ordering</h4>

  * Big Endian and Little Endian
  * changes the order of the bytes by ordering by least significant byte or most significant byte
  * x86 is Little Endian
