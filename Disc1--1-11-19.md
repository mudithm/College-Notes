      - breakpoint.png
  * Makefile:
      - default: build code
      - clean: deletes every file that the makefile creates
      - dist: builds tarball
      - Lab0: check as well. Smoketest
          + Possibly do several sample runs and check for the correct output/exit codes
  * README:
      - talk a bit about each of the files, and any other information like bugs, etc

<h4>Lab 0</h4>

  * read from fd 0 (stdin)
  * write what's read to fd 1 (stdout)
  * if successful,
      - exit with code 0
  * flags:
      - `--input=(input filename)`
          + errors exit with status 2
      - `--output=(output filename)`
          + errors exit with status 3
      - `--segfault`
          + force a segmentation fault (ie storing in a null pointer)
      - `--segfault --catch` 
          + handle the segmentation fault
          + exit with status 4
      - `--dump-core`
          + dump the core, exit with status 139
      - bad arguments exit with status 1
  * backtrace
      - in GDB
          + `backtrace` or `bt`
      - take a screenshot
  * breakpoint:
      - set a breakpoint at null pointer for segfault
      - print the breakpoint in breakpoint.png

<h4>Getopt</h4>

  * getopt_long:    
      - `int argc`
      - `char * const argv`
      - `const char *optstring ("ioscd")`
      - long opts: `struct option ... {}`
      - long index: `NULL`
