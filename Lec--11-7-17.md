<h5>Hydrothermal Vents</h5>

  * Fissure in a planets surface from which geothermally heated water issues.
  * Commonly near volcanically active regions
      - Tectonoic plate subduction zones, ovean basins, hotspots
  * Extreme parameters
      - Temp gradient from 2 C (ambient) to 400 C
      - Strong gradients and reduction of elements to form Hydrogen Sulfide ranging from 0 to > 4mM and metals (1 to > 1000 microM for Mn, and < 1 to 200 microM for Fe)
  * The microbes at these locations perform chemosynthesis, but animals near them rely on oxygen created through photosynthesis.

<h6>Adaptations: Utilization of Hydrogen Sulfide</h6>

  * Highly vascularized red Plume at the tip of thier free end, exchanged compoinds with the environment * like H2S, CO2, o2, etc.
  * contains a specialized trophosome with bacteria inside that provide them with oxygen, hydrgen sulfide, carbon dioxide, etc
  * The bacteria can turn these compounds into organic compounds when the chemosynthesis occurs.

<h6>Adaptations: Temperature</h6>

  * Pompeii Worm
      - tail in hot water (80c), head in colder, (22C). 

<h6>Adaptations: Utilization of Iron Sulfides</h6>

  * Hot Vent Gastropod
      - lives near black smoker shimneys
      - foot covered by scale shaped sclerites, mineralized with pyrite FeS2, and greigite Fe3S4
      - only animal known to have such a protective layer

<h5>Hot Springs</h5>

<h6>Thermophylic Bacterial Photosynthetis</h6>

  * Syrrechococcus Cyanobacterium
  * Cyanobaccterium phormidium
  * Calothrix Cyanobacterium
 *121 C is the current upper limit of observed life*

<h6>Brine Pools</h6>

  * Large areas of brine on the ocean basin
  * 
  * extremely high salinity as compared to the surrounding ocean
  * caused by the motion of large salt deposits (evaporites) through salt tectonics
  * Methane is also often inhigh concentration in these areas, providing energy for chemosynthesis
  * Brine pools are considered lakes within the ocean
  * High salinity creates a distinct surface and shoreline that water with lower concentrations cannot exits.
  * organisms that rely on methane and hydrogen sulfide sybiotically pair with mussels in their gills in these locations
  * BRine fields can be fonud in 
      - The Mediterranean sea
      - the red sea
      - the gulf of mexico
  * Salinities up to 20% (normal is 3.5%)
  * anoxic
  * temps up to 70 c

<h6>Journey to the Center of the Earth</h6>

  * They say that my name is jeff and that I like memes.

<h6>Deep Biosphere</h6>

  * Half of all prokaryotic microorganisms on Earth are fonud deep down in the seabed (estimated avg 500 m depth)
  * The biomass of sub-seafloor microorganisms corresponds 1/10 to 1/3 of all the total living biomass on earth

<h6>Permafrost</h6>

  * Soil at or below freezing point of water for two or more years
  * Approx 20% of earths surface is permafrost or glacial ice
  * thin active layer on top of thermofrost
  * thickness depends on the locations, but is usually .6 - 4 mm thick
  * In areas of continuous permafrost, like Siberia, it can be as much as 1500 meters.

<h6>Life in Permafrost</h6>

  * Three types of lifeforms
      - Active Ones
      - Viable but inactive ones
      - frozen microbe carcasses
  * Methanogenesis can occur in permarost down to almos -15 c
  * Permafrost organisms are very sensitive to the effects of global warming.

<h6>Sea Ice</h6>

  * briny habitat
  * strong temperature gradients exist in the ice ,from -2c to -35c
  * in winter, brine salinities reach 25% and salts begin to precipitate
  * Organisms need to prevent the frowth of ice crystals in their bodies
  * Single celled algae form chains int the things. Cool.
  * 
Under antarctica, there are lakes that have been isolated for 35 mio years.!!!

<h6>Acidic Rivers</h6>

  * Rio Tinto
  * Low pH, high iron, copper and zinc
  * Iberian Pyritic Belt (Spain)
      - Deposited in the Carboniferous by hydrothermal acticities othe sea floor
      - tartessans and iberians started mining in 3k bc
      - up until the 2nd part of the 15rh century
      - Acid mine drainage or acid rock drainage
          + After being exposed to air and water, oitation of metal sulfides (often pyrite) wutgub tge syrrubdubg ricj and overburdeninf ,,,
  * Reactions with Acidithiobacillus Ferrooxidans
  * 


Other extreme systems:
    Caves
        no light
        isolation frfom outside nutrition
        sometimes toxic gases
    Intertidal zone
        desiccation
        freezing
        uv radiation
        change in salinity
