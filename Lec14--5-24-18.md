_Reformation, continued_

<h4>From last time</h4>

  * Luther and Augustine
      - Salvation:
          + Nothing you do in life is enough, only by the Grace of God
      - Also, he was an Augustinian monk
  * Luther and Indulgences
      - Only god can be involved in decisions regarding Salvation -- peeps don't have any effect.
  * Luther's theology:
      - cutting out the middleman
          + men and women should have direct access to God, and vice versa
  * Luther and Politics:
      - Politics
          + His words were widely distributed, so he couldn't be easily silenced by the Church

<h4>Charles V</h4>

  * Inherited a bunch of nations from his ancestors
  * tries to reunify them
  * used religion to do this
      - decides to use Catholicism to unify the lands he inherited
  * Political Structure:
      - Seven Prince-electors and one Emperor
      - Archbishops so that they couldn't pass on their rule to children

<h4>Luther, Frederick the Wise, and Charles V</h4>

  * Charles and the Pope don't like him
  * Luther is excommunicated at Worms
  * Charles V wants him executed, but Freddy the wise decides to protect him as leverage against Charles V
      - keeps him in his castle
      - Translation of the New Testament released during this time
      - Shift from Empire to Nation State is solidified
  * Charles V thinks this is just a fluke, and tries to punish Frederick
  * Other electors "rebel" and turn Protestant
      - form the Shmalkaldic league
      - eventually, Charles V signs Peace of Augsburg and retires to priesthood
          + dies soon after
  * cuius regio, eius religio
      - Territorial sovereigns decide which religion their kingdom/province follows
      - NOT toleration, peeps might still get killed for being protestant in a catholic territory or vice versa
  * Breaking down of unity, formation of territorial churches
  * Charles V's empire ends

<h4>Political Implications =/= Political leadership</h4>

  * Luther was not a political leader
  * Peasants' War (1524-1525)
  * Luther condemned them, many were killed
  * Mistook a spiritual freedom for political/economic freedom

<h4>Reformation in England</h4>

  * Henry VIII becomes a protestant so that he can escape the authority of the Pope
  * to be divorced from his wife bc he thought she wouldn't produce an heir

<h4>Calvinism</h4>

  * Calvin:
      - Born in France
      - 2nd generation Reformer
      - Tries to make a lasting, systematized religion
      - Educated in the Humanist tradition
      - Moved from France to Geneva
      - Wrote _Foundations of the Christian Religion_
  * Two main issues of Calvinism:   
      - Relationship between State and Church
          + Divides peeps into categories:
                  - Elders (in charge of discipline)
                  - Doctors (teachers, etc)
                  - Pastors (in charge of preachers)
                  - Deacons (in charge of charities)
                      + large-scale philanthropy
      - Predestination
          + Like Luther, Calvin believed in Predestination
          + BUT, you might see signs that you are on the right track
              * prosperity, etc
              * as long as you are morally good

<h4>Source: Calvin, Institutio Christianae religionis</h4>

  * Calvin conflates Law and Religion
      - punishments should be similar for both
      - Discipline is necessary at every level of society, and so punishments for both moral and legal infractions should be treated similarly


<h4>Calvinism, Capitalism, and Max Weber</h4>
