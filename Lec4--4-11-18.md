_Machine-Level Programming: Control_

---

<h4>Control, in general</h4>

  * By default, `%RIP` points to `next contiguous address` 
  * The `jmp` operator can change the instruction that `%RIP` points to
      - The next contiguous instruction then becomes the "not taken" branch, and the instruction pointed to by the jump becomes the "taken" branch

<h4>Condition Codes -- implicit</h4>

  * Carry flag
      - For unsigned operation: captures overflow (ie addition that goes over int limit)
  * Sign flag
      - Checks most significant bit
  * zero flag
      - checks if value is 0
  * Overflow Flag
      - checks for overflow

<h4>Condition Codes -- Explicit</h4>

  * CMPQ v SUBQ
      - `CMPQ` does not write to the register file
      - `SUBQ` does
      - if you just want to just check one of the flags, use `cmpq` (if all you need are the condition codes)
      - `CMPQ` or `TESTQ` (Which does an and)

<h4>Branches/jumps</h4>

  * `jmp`:  unconditional jump
  * control

<h4>Switch statement</h4>

  * Indirect branch
      - jump that does not have an explicitly defined destination
  * Jump table: array of possible destinations/targets (case statements)

<h4>Loops</h4>

  * l

<h4>Summ</h4>

  * Conditionals and general jumps
  * Loops
  * Jump tables and switch
