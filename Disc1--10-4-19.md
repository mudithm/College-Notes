Look into Measures and Measure theory
  * Measure Space
  * Probability Space
  * Sigma algebra
  * measure mu

<h5>Interpreting Prob</h5>

  * Frequentist interpretation
      - Rand experiment is run N_x times, and event B occurs N_c times
      - The frequentist then assn prob B as
          + P(B) = lim(N_X->inf) (N_c/N_x)
  * Bayesian Interpretation
      - Instead of freuqency, use a reasonable expectation for that event to occur given info about hte context
      - Hypo is given a certain prob, based on prior knowledge (prior prob)
          + updated when new evidence is obtained (posterior prob)

<h5>Elements of Prob</h5>

  * Samp Space
  * sigma - algebra event space F: set of events A in F (possible set of outcomes of an experiment)
  * Go over your 170a notes my dude
      - Bayes' rule
      - distributions
      - general set theory
      - pmf
      - pdf
      - cdf
      - joint and marginal distrs
      - expected value, variance
          + properties
      - Covariance / correlation
      - __Central Limit Theorem__
          + Gaussian is applicable in a lot of different places

<h5>Distributions</h5>

  * `x ~ p(x)` --> `x` was sampled from a prob distr `p(x)` 
  * Joint and marginal distributions

<h5>Random Vectors</h5>

  * Vectors of random variables

<h5>Matrix Product</h5>

  * Inner/Outer Product
  * Positive Semi-Definite

 <h5>Convex functions</h5> 

   * second derivative is always non-neg
   * jensen's ineq:
       - Secant line lies above the actual graph
       - look that shibb up
       - general: f(E[x]) <= E[f(x)] 

x/abs(x) + e^x

abs(x) - x(x/abs(x))   + e^x
(abs(x)^2)            

abs(x) - x^2 / abs(x)   + e^x
abs(x)^2
