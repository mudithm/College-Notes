<h4>C vs C++</h4>

  * Variables must be declared on a line prior to use
      - ie `int i` and then `for (i = 0 ...` rather than `for (int i = 0 ...` 
  * memory allocation comes from `malloc`, `calloc`, and `realloc`
      - Use `void *` pointers, which can be reassigned to any type.
      - Returns a memory address

<h4>Conditioning without if</h4>

  * return (first bitwise comparison) | (second bitwise comparison)
