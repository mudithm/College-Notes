<h3>What we care abt w/ a priori/a posteriori and Analytic/synthetic</h3>

  * Declarative Statements
      - can be either true or false
  * The company that makes the best smartphone
      - ???
  * S stands for a particular statement
  * What empiricists think:
      - If S is a priori, then S is analytic
          + true
      - If S is analytics, then S is a priori
          + true
      - If S is synthetic, then S is a posteriori
          + true
      - If S is a posteriori, then S is synthetic
          + true
      - Rationalists would disagree with all of these claims except perhaps the last

<h3>Arguments</h3>

  * An argument is a series of connected statements intende to establish a proposition
  * Functional parts:
      - say which part(s) is(are) the premise, and which is the conclusion
          + Premise 1
          + Premise 2
          + ...
          + --------
          + Conclusion
      - If P, then Q
  * Deductive arguments
      - validity and soundness
          + soundness: true premises + validity
      - Truth of the premise, validity of the structure
  * Inductive arguments
      - cogency
  * If an argument is sound, then it is valid
      - True
  * A sound argument must have a true conclusion
      - True
  * It is possible for an invalid argument to have all true premises and a true conclusion
      - true

<h3>Examples</h3>

  * P1: All dogs are mammals
  * P2: All huskies are mammals
  * C: All huskies are dogs
      - True premises and true conclusion, but the premises don't support the conclusion
      - Not following the logical inference rules
      - argument structure is invalid even though the conclusion is true
  * Switching P2 and C:
  * P1: All dogs are mammals
  * P2: All huskies are dogs
  * C: All dogs are mammals
  * This argument has true premises that support a valid conclusion
      - follows logical inference rules
      - argument structure is valid and conclusion is true

<h3>The Problem of Induction</h3>

  * Accidentally true generalizations or cogent generalization?
      - 
  * Confirmation/evidential support
  * Primitive view: We confirm a generalization when one of its consequences turns out (repeatedly) to be true
  * T => (T or S)
      - If we show S is true, then this statement shows that any T is true

```
x is emerald
          iff
x is grue <=> x is green AND observed pre-2030
                OR
              x is blue AND observed post-2030

x is blue, observed 2020, is x grue? NO

x is bleen <=> x is blue AND observed pre-2030
                OR
              x is green AND observed post-2030
```

This defines Bleen and Grue in terms of Green and Blue, colors that we understand in our day-to-day language. But what if there was some Planet 2 that had Bleen and Grue as their primary colors?

They might define green as follows:

```
x is green <=> x is grue AND observed pre-2030
                    OR
               x is bleen AND observed post-2030
```

<h3>Verification Theory of Meaning</h3>

  * A non-analytic statement is only meaningful if it is verifiable by sense experience. S, any meaningful sentence must have consequences that can be tested by observation. if it does not have such consequences, it is not meaningful
  * Empiricists connect verifiability to language
  * There is a degree of subjective belief to this (contradiction in believing the verification theory but not being able to verify the theory through senses)
