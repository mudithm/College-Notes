<h3>Nancy Cartwright(1944-)</h3>

  * One of the main themes of her work is the enormous complexity of the world and the way that taking it into account forces us to revise standard pictures
  * Her best known book is probably still her first, **How the Laws of Physics lie**

<h3>The Truth Doesn't Explain Much</h3> 

  * She rehearses some standard complaints about the Covering-Law model, namely, that it suggests certain things are explanatory of other things when they aren't
  * Her novel contribution is this:
      - The covering-Law model supposes that explanation works by discovering laws (universal truths of a certain sort) and then using deduction
  * But 1) Such laws are hard to come by and 2) not having such laws does not stop us from explaining things
      - Why did the price of oil recently drop?
      - A good answer: the demand went down
      - But what law covers this situation
          + If it were true that whenever the demand for something drops, the price drops, then we could deduce from that law and the claim that the demand for oil dropped that the price of oil dropped
          + That isn't a true law though. 
          + Cartwright things that if we want to say something true, we should say the following:
              * Ceteris paribus, whenever the demand for somethings drops, the price for it drops
                  - Ceteris paribus -- all else being equal
  * When we put "ceteris paribus" on the front of a false statement it can turn into a true statement. Even when it does, we cannot straightforwardly deduce the explanandum
      - For example, this is not a valid deduction
      - Ceteris paribus whenever demand goes down, price goes down
      - Demand for oil went down
      - -----
      - Price of oil went down
  * We need to show that all else is equal -- or else the deduction does not hold
  * This is a valid deduction
      - Ceteris paribus whenever demand goes down, price goes down
      - Demand for oil went down
      - Other things were equal
  * But not a Covering-Law model
  * But, she things that other things are never truly equal. So this deduction also contains a false premise
  * The upshot, for her, is that we do not need to deduce the explanandum from true laws to explain it
  * how does explanation work if it doesn't involve deduction from true laws?
  * We cite causal factors that are responsible. Demand is one of the factors that makes a difference to price, but supply is another
      - We can cite the predominant causes in an explanation
  * In many cases, we might not even know all of the causal factors at work, but this doesn't stop us from knowing which one is responsible
