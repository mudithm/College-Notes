    int k = 1;
    while (k <= 100){
    ...
    ...
    ...
    ...
    ...
    k++
    }

This separation of the control variables is sometimes problematic. It makes it more difficult to understand the while loop and more likely that human error will be introduced.

For loop approach

    for (int k = 1; k <= 100; k++){
        ...
        ...
        ...
        ...
        ...
    }

---| V First V | V Second V  | V Fourth V  
---|---|---|---
for ( | int k = 1; | k <= 100; | k++) {
 | **Third (body)** | | 
 } | | | 


 for ( *initialization; stay-in-loop condition; prepare-for-next iteration* ) 
       *statement*


If you use the wrong iterator (i.e. i++ instead of i--), the loop will eventually stop when the integer limit is reached.
> if the integer tries to iterate past the integer limit, it is reset to the smallest possible integer.

<h6>Off by One Errors</h6>

  * one of the most common loop errors
  * keep in mind that my name is jeff and I like memes because I am a true memer whose meme skills are limited only by the imagination.
  * always check when you use a <= or >= operator.

*Your choice of a for loop iterator should be related to the condition of the loop and should be simple*

Working with Strings

Programmers and language designers had to find a way to represent subscripts in code.

In FORTRAN, this was done by putting the number to be a subscript between parentheses.

Later languages chose to use [square brackets] instead. 

To find a certain character in a string: 

    ...
    string k = "Hello";
    cout << s[0] << endl;
    ...


This segment would output "H".

To find the length of the string, use this notation:

    ...
    k.size();
    /*stringname*/.size()
    ...

OR

    ...
    k.length()
    /*stringname*/.length()
    ...

In Java:

    ...
    s.charAt(k);
    ...

```c++
    #include <iostream>
    #include <string>

    using namespace std;

    int main(){
        cout << "Enter some text:  ";
        string t;
        getline(cin, t);

        int numE = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < t.size(); i++){
            if (t[i] == 'e' || t[i] == 'E')
                numE++;
        }

        cout << numE << endl;

    }
```

string s = "Hello!";        s is a String       ""  "a"     "@!"    "abc123" "abc\ndef"

char c = s[1];              c is a char (initialized to lower case e)
    'a'     '@'     ' '     '4'     '\n'


The char type can only hold one character (not 0, not 2)
