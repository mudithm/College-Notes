<h3>Scientific Realism</h3>

  * A scientific realist thinks that since is attempting to capture the way the world really is and, on some stronger versions, holds that it has largely achieved that goal already
  * Part of Scientific Realism is "Common Sense Realism", the idea that there is a "mind-independent" world.
  * The philosopher Berkeley (1685-1753) thought that "to be is to be perceived"
      - That sort of view rejects common sense realism
  * People who are opposed to realism are called "anti-realists"

<h3>Scientific Realism: Version 1</h3>

  * Our best scientific theories do (or probably do) accurately describe reality, and it is a reality that exists independently of our beliefs about it.
  * Argument for this version: from Hilary Putnam (1926-2016) and the "miracle argument"
      - If our best theories were false, it would be a miracle for them to make predictions that are as accurate as they are.
      - It is not a miracle that they make such accurate predictions
      - -----
      - So, they are not false (i.e. they are true)
  * But would it really be a miracle?
  * Often we can explain why a false theory worked so well by using a better theory. That helps us see that it need not be miraculous for a false theory to make very good predictions.

<h3>An argument against this version</h3>

  * The Pessimistic Induction (Laudan)
      - The caloric theory was wrong about the unobservable
      - The phlogiston theory was wrong about the unobservable
      - Newton's theory of gravity was wrong about the unobservable
      - The theory of the luminiferous ether was wrong..., etc
      - -------
      - Our currently best theories are wrong about the unobservable
  * This is an induction, so some phils would not consider it ok

<h3>What do these premises say?</h3> 

  * If they are saying that our past theories were wrong about *everything* they said about the unobservable, then they are not true
  * If they are saying that our past theories were wrong about *some* things they said about the unobservable, then they are true, but the conclusion should likewise say that our current theories are wrong about some things. that isn't that devastating or surprising.
  * Maybe a realist can say that this is consistent with the *spirit* of their view, though we can wonder if it is consistent with the letter

<h3>A variant of the 1st version</h3>

  * Some realists would rather that one say that our best theories are "approximately true " or "close to true."
  * But what does this mean? Maybe it makes sense for statements involving numbers
      - Pi = 3.14
      - Pi = 3.1415
  * But is is the case that "There is phlogiston" is approximately true, and, if so, what is the right account of "approximate truth"

<h3>Scientific Realism Version 2</h3> 

  * The aim of science is to discover truths about a mind-independent world. 
      - (This account of scientific realism is due to van Fraasen, though he does not believe it)
  * van Fraasen does not think this is a reasonable aim to have because he believes a strong thesis about the underdetermination of theory by evidence
  * Mary Hesse's (1924 - 2016)
  * UDT 1: For any given theory T, which is acceptable on the basis of some body of evidence R, there is at least one other incompatible and acceptable theory T', which is empirically equivalent to T
  * UDT 2: At any given time, there are always alternative theories such that (a) they are given some degree of support by available evidence, and (b) they imply incompatible real worlds

<h3>Why think there is always an empirically equivalent rival to a theory T?</h3>
  
  * Because one can construct them
  * T: Quantum Electrodynamics
  * T': The world appears to be as QED says, but it isn't
      - more specific, try "but there are no electrons"
  * Isn't this only the sort of example a philosopher can love? Are there more substantive examples of empirically equivalent theories?
