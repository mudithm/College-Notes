<h3>Interactive Proof</h3>

  * Proofs that you allow someone to "blindfold" you, make some changes to the thing you are trying to judge, and if you are able to still make accurate judgements after a large number of trials, the verifier will be reasonably sure that you either
      - can judge as you've said you can, or
      - are extremely lucky
  * __F13.1__
  * In the second type of proof (interactive) we allow interaction between the prover and the verifier.
      - Completeness: If p is honest, p should have a strategy to convince V to accept for any x &isin; L
      - Soundness: If P<sup>&ast;</sup> is dishonest (there is no strategy) then P<sup>&ast;</sup> for ANY strategy cannot make V accept, (except with negligble probability) over Verifier's coins (verifier is probabalistic)

<h3>Completeness</h3>

  * &forall; x &isin; L
      - Pr<sub>V's coin flips</sub>[P &harr; V(x) = 1] &gt; 2/3

<h3>Soundness</h3> 

  * &forall; x &notin; L
      - Pr<sub>V's coin flips</sub>[P &harr; V(x) = 1] &lt; 1/n<sup>c</sup>

<h3>Example: Interactive proofs are  more powerful than Non-int (traditional) proofs</h3>

  * A graph G = (V, E) consists of some number of vertices and the edges connecting said vertices
<br>
  * Isomorphic graphs can have different labels for these nodes and edges, but they are equivalent in terms of structure (all edges remain edges, and all non-edges remain non-edges)
  * Math: if &exist; some permutation &pi;: G<sub>1</sub>&rarr;G<sub>2</sub> s. t. all edges and all non-edges are preserved
  * L<sub>1</sub>: GI (graph isomorphism):  pairs of GRAPHS that are isomorphic
  * L<sub>2</sub>: GNI: pairs of graphs that are not isomorphic
  * Using a traditional math argument, we don't know how to distinguish these two.
  * __F13.2__
  * G<sub>1</sub> is not isomorphic to G<sub>2</sub>
  * Interactive proof can show whether or not two graphs are isomorphic
      - Case 1: prover is lying
          + we will catch them with very high probability. Negligible prob they get away with cheating, would mean they are incredibly lucky
      - Case 2: prover is not lying
          + bc it is so unlikely they are cheating, we can be reasonable sure that they are telling the truth and that they can determine whether or not two graphs are isomorphic
      - If the prover has some magical ability to det whether or not two graphs are isomorphic, a polytime verifier can confirm that this is correct 
          + Point: verifier should work as little as possible to verify, prover can work as hard as it needs to.
      - Statistical evidence, not a hardcore proof.

<h3>Another proof strategy</h3>

  * __F13.3__
  * If the prover is lying, then the verifier will catch the prover cheating with probability 1/2.
  * Zero knowledge (GMR Paper)
      - Prover and verifier run some interactive proof
      - Prover somehow convinces Verifier that the sample X is in the language L
      - but, V learned nothing from talking to P other than that X &isin; L.
      - Additionally, all Zero Knowledge proofs are also interactive proofs
          + Also called Zero Knowledge Interactive Proofs
      - There also exist non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs, but they are a bit too advanced for this class

  * IP for L is Zero Knowledge if &forall; V<sup>&ast;</sup> &isin; PPT &exist; S<sub>v<sup>&ast;</sup></sub>
