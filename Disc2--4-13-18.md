<h4>GDB</h4>

  * GNU project debugger
  * ayy

<h4>Symbol table</h4>

  * GDB requires symbol tables
      - Maps instructions in the compied program to their corresponding variable, function, ore line in the source code
      - use the `-g` flag while compiling with gcc
      - `gcc meme.c -g -o meme` 
      - Syntax to start gdb:
          + `gdb  (NOT .c)` 
      - Commands:
          + `list n`
              * gives the line specified and a few around it
              * `list (function)` lists a specific function
              * just `list` with no arguments show the first few lines of code, and the subsequent lines if repeated 
          + `break n` or `b n` 
              * makes a break point at the specified line
              * can also use `b functionName` to create a breakpoint at every call to that function.
          + `watch (conditional)`
              * sets a watch point; pauses the program when condition changes (x==3 for example)
          + `continue`
              * continues program
          + `delete N`
              * deletes a breakpoint
          + `run`
              * executes the program
          + `next`
              * executes the next source line
          + `step`
              * executes the next instruction
          + `ctrl+d`
              * quits GDB
          + `print x`
              * prints the value of a variable
              * or for any register (using `/d` for dec or `/x` for hex)
          + `set disassemble-next-line on`
              * gives assembly output on next `next` or `step`
          + `x/x $rbp`
              * returns the value of rbp, and the value stored at that mem location (in hex for both)
              * `d/d` specifies decimal
              * `b/b` specifies decimal
          + `s` takes you to next line
          + `si` takes you to next instruction
          + `step` will stop before a branch, `next` will follow that branch
          + `info b` or `i b` lists breakpoints and how many times they were accessed
          + `disas funcname` 
              * disassemble a function
          + `bt`
              * print current mem address and stack backtrace (`where` does the same)
          + `info program`
              * gives current status of program
          + `call funcName(argumetns)`
              * calls the function with an output

<h4>Breakpoint</h4>

  * something that allows you to pause at a certain point in the code
