<h3>Longino piece  -- Gender, Politics, and the Theoretical Virtues</h3>

  * Later Kuhn (in "Objectivity, Values, and Theory Choice")
  * Theoretical Virtues (virtues of a theory):
      - Accuracy
      - Simplicity
      - Consistency (both internal and external)
      - Breadth of Scope
      - Fruitfulness
  * These virtues can come into conflict -- depending on the paradigm, different ones can take priority over others


<h3>Helen Longino (1944-)</h3>

  * Constitutive values (or Cognitive Values) are those that "enhance the likelihood of the truth of the theory"
  * Contextual Values are those that promote social or practical interests
      - ie a theory of fluid dynamics can enable you to make airplanes, etc.
  * Longino wants to argue in this paper that the virtues Kuhn listed do not serve solely as constitutive values, but also have a kind of concealed contextual values

<h3>Another set of values, raised by feminists</h3>

  * Empirical adequacy
  * Novelty
  * Ontological Heterogeneity
  * Complexity of Interaction
  * Applicability to Human Needs
  * Diffusion or Decentralization of Power

>The "ontology" of a theory is a list of items that exist according to it

<h3>A natural pairing</h3>

  * Feminist list / Traditional list
  * Empirical Adequacy / Accuracy
  * Novelty / Consistency
  * Ontological heterogeneity / simplicity
  * Complexity of Interaction / Breadth of Scope

<h3>Final thoughts</h3>

  * Although it isn't her explicit, main goal, Longino does point out places in which the "traditional virtues" lead one astray when it comes to truth
  * So the overall point seems to be that one should not think that the traditional virtues are solely constitutive but also they don't obviously have more of a claim to being constitutive than the virtues on the feminist list
  * One possibility is that which set provides the real constitutive virtues is, itself, an empirical matter and it even opens up the possibility that it depends upon what science one is talking about
