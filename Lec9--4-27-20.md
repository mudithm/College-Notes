<h3>Digital Signatures</h3>

  * Public key
      - d
  * Secret key
      - ds
  * Key-gen alg
      - KEY-GEN(k, r) &rarr; (PubKey, SecKey)
  * Sign documents with respect to PBLIC KEYS
      - Sign(D, Pk, Sk, randomness r) &rarr; signature &sigma;(D)\
  * Verify
      - verify (D, sigma;(D), Pk) &rarr; 1/0
          + 1 correct, 0 wrong
  * Signature scheme:
      - 3 algorightms
      - Keygen, Sign, Verify
  * If you signed some document, everyone should accept your own signature as valid
      - &forall; D if run all 3 algorithms correctly &rarr; verify shoud output 1 always.
  * Unforgability:
      - Nobody should be able to "forge" your signature 
      - What's forgery?
          + Verify(D, Pk, &sigma;(D)) &rarr; 1
              * forgery if output 1 on d but you didn't sign D

<h3>Definition of security of digital signature scheme</h3>

  * Sig-scheme(keygen, sign, verify) is existentially & adaptively secure if any poly-time adversary that can get signatures of his choice cannot forge any new document
  * Game: __F9.2__
  * A signature scheme is secure if no polytime forger exists (poly in k)
