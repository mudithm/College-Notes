The syntax to declare a function:

``` c++
    void greet(int nTimes, string msg);
```

without a function definition, is called a `function prototype`

---

In C, if the main function does not end in a return statement, it will return a random garbage value.

In C++, if you do not explicitly return a value, it defaults to 0.

---

The cctype library has several useful functions, including:
        
``` c++
        isdigit(char c);
        isalpha(char c);
        islower(char c);
        isupper(char c);
        //and some others that are less commonly used.
```
