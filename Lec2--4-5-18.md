          + Romans were pantheistic, willing to accept Christian and Jewish gods
          + Christians and Jews were not willing to worship the emperor
          + resulted in persecution, etc
          + Values were different: Romans were violent, vengeful, etc
          + Christians/jews were compassionate, forgiving, pride was a sin, etc
