<h5>Negotiation Exercise -- Instructions</h5>
  * You will receive an email from the TA containing general instructions and specific instructions for your side
  * General instructions:
      - If something is unclear, ignore it
      - Side communications are a no-go
          + Do not communicate with other students in the class during a negotiation
      - After you are done with your negotiation, you will get a google form which *one* of the two negotiating persons should fill out.
      - You will get a time period (12 minutes, for now) to both read and do your negotiations

<h5>Tactics</h5>
  * Anchoring at the end, giving myself space, but being reasonable
  * anchoring more extremely to flush out the other side and learn their expectations and restraints
  * pretend that ideal price is the bottom line
  * making lots of moves a tthe very beginning andat the end
  * using very small increments to signal nearing the bottome line (even when not)
  * Repeating the same price to signal a barrier
  * respond to repeating prices by going backwards
  * creating time pressure by delaying
  * going backwards to siganl aggression / punish bad behavior
  * refusing to signal emotion or signaling angry emotion
  * long delays before responding -- might show considering, might show annoyance, might invite negotiation against oneself


<h5>Takeaways from the Exercise</h5>
  * One school of thought (not necessarily a good one): Trying to get the other side to overvalue what you have to offer and undervalue what they have to offer
      - Try to get them to believe that you are not super interested in coming to an agreement
      - who has the leverage in the negotiation
  * Deception
      - can use the tactics to "deceive" the other party
  * Who starts the negotiation
      - Generally, let the other one start
      - Sometimes, it can be very difficult to move the other party after they make an offer (ie in a job negotiation, where the other person wants to (for ego, etc) keep their original offer & gets attached to it)

<h5>Important things to keep in mind</h5>
  * The goal is to come to a stable agreemnet that neither side will try to wriggle of
  * think about the other side's perspective, what they know, what they want, and what you can provide
