<h4>Another fundamental European power: the Papacy</h4>

  * Christianity rides the wave of Greg VII to get stronger
      - important difference bt pope and kings--pope does not have an army
      - neither does he have much political control
          + mostly moral and conscience
      - Not political, territorial, or military strength, but INTELLECTUAL and CULTURAL control

<h4>Doctrinal Strength</h4>

  * Fourth Lateran council (1215) and the fight against Heresy
  * Doctrinal uniformity (from council of Nicea) still to be enforced
  * Important decisions such as over Eucharist and Purgatory
      - "Invention" of the church
  * Strong action against the heretics after all other measures taken
  * How was it enforced?
      - Franciscans and Dominicans

<h4>Franciscans and Dominicans</h4>

  * St. Francis of Assisi
      - spoke to birds
      - "environmentalist" ish
  * St. Dominic de Guzman
      - Intellectual
      - Dominicans were the Inquisitors
  * Differences:
  * St Francis
      - on the website there is his Rule
      - Emphasis on the example of Christ
      - We study "propoganda", motivations, etc
      - Emphasis on Absolute Poverty
      - Link with Pope
      - Francis as part of the pope's propaganda, but insisting on 'absolute poverty' is a double edged sword
          + some thought it was a criticism of the wealth of the Church
  * St Dominic
      - Some stuff on his canonization process
      - emphasized the kinds of qualities the papacy liked to see
      - Emphasis on discipline (structure as well as punishment)
      - Poverty is important, but less emphasized
      - A lot of attention to study: the Dominicans as the Ppapal 'scholars' and Inquisitors

<h4>Source: Bernard Gui, manual for Inquisitors</h4>

  * The Beguines are too secretive
  * take too much initiative and try to interpret theological works without the guidance of a priest
  * They think St. Francis's words are more important than those of St Francis (they don't need to follow a pope who disagrees with St Francis)
  * Think that the carnal church is on the side of he evil (should be considered part of the good)
  * Ultimate nightmare is the unbridled sexuality of women
      - sin, sexuality without procreation
  Look at the slides, last bullet
  All this jazz was a result of the papacy extending their power

<h4>Albigensian Crusade</h4>

  * Crusade against the enemies within the Church
  * Who are the Cathars?
      - Religious Dualism
      - concept of religious 'perfection'
      - Focused on Lucifer and the struggle against him
  - All of them were exterminated
  * RI Moore and some other historians thought that the meme was made up, and that the peeps were perfectly normal, orthodox christians, and the pope exaggerated their memes to make an example of them that this is what happens when you defy him
