Introduction to _Introduction to Machine Learning_

<h5>Professor's Background</h5>

  * Kai-Wei Chang
  * Based in NLP

---

<h5>What is Machine Learning?</h5>

  * Machine learning is about predicting the future based on the past
  * The study of algorithms that
    - Improve their performance
    - at some task
    - with experience E
  * A well-defined learning task is given by <P, T, E>
  * In other words, improve on task T, with respect to performance metric P, based on experience E

<h5>Applications: Spam Detection</h5>

  * `Binary Classification Task`: assign one of two labels (ie yes/no) to the input (here, an email message)
  * Classification requires a model (classifier) to determine which label to assign to items
  * We study algorithms and techniques to learn such models from data

---

<h5>Building Fundamental Knowledge</h5>

  * You'll learn the basic terminology/theory required to read ML papers
  * What ML Beginners do
      - How to train an image classifier?
          + Deep Learning!
          + This requires a lot of data, and it doesn't work for everythin
  * You will learn how to decide which model to use for which situation (theoretically or empirically)

<h5>Goals of the Course</h5>

<h4>What is machine learning?</h4>

<h5>Learning</h5>

  * LEarning is at the core of
      - understanding high-level cognition
      - performing knowledge-intensive inferences
      - building adaptive intelligent systems
      - dealing with messy, real-world data
  * Learning has mult purposes
      - knowledge acquisition
      - integration of various knowledge sources to ensure robust behavior
      - adaptation
      - decision making based on different kinds of evidence
  * Learning = Generalization
      - H. Simon quote
          + denotes changes in system that are adaptive in the sense that they enable the system to do the tasks drawn from the same population more efficiently and more effectively the next time
      - Classification
          + medical diagnoses, etc
      - Planning and Acting
          + Navigation, game playing, etc
      - Skills
          + balancing, playing tennis. etc
      - Common sense reasoning
          + NL interactions, etc
      - Common feature: perform a task that it has never encountered using learned experiences

<h5>State of the art ML</h5>

  * Autonomous cars
  * Computer Vision
  * Speech Recognition
  * Reinforcement Learning (games, etc) 


---

<h5>Types of Learning Protocols</h5>

  * Supervised Learning
      - Given: labeled training instances
      - Goal: learn mapping that predicts label for test instance
      - Training Phase and Test Phase
      - Regression: learn a function f(x) to predict y given x
          + y is real-valued == regression
  * Unsupervised Learning
      - Given: unlabeled inputs
      - Goal: it depends
      - Decipher
  * Reinforcement Learning
      - Given: sequence of states and actions w rewards
      - Learn policy that maximizes agent's rewards
  * Representing Instances/examples
      - how do you represent characteristics/features
  * Learning Algorithm
      - During Learning/training/induction, learn a model of what distinguishes desired from undesired objects
      - Learning is about generalizing from training data

<h5>Challenges</h5>

  * Representation: how to represent input/output?
  * What is the right model?
      - depds on size of data, type of problem, prior knowledge, etc
      - depds on goal: model size/ test-time budget, etc
  * Debugging
      - a lot has to line up for a successful ML
      - Need enough correct data, strong labels, plenty of data, etc
  * Structured Inference
  * Robustness
  *
