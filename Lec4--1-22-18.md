<h4>Heian Period</h4>

  * imperial order centered around capital
  * through values, etiquettes, relifions shared in the court
  * bureaucratic system
  * established as civilized and cultured peoples
  * actual power was held by Fujiwara clan in Mid Heian period

 <h4>Late Heian to Kamakura Period </h4> 

   * Fall of imperial order
   * series of wars and rise of warriors
   * Pure Land Buddhism as an alternative to the imperial view of the world

<h4>Era of Cloistered Emperors (1068 - 1160)</h4>

  * Decline of Fujiwara Clan
      - 1068 Emperor Go-sanjo accedes to the throne

          + Cloistered emperors:
              * withdraw into the buddhist monastic community
              * make his son the emperor and hold the political power on his behalf
              * attempts to control the Shoen system
          + retired emperors become real power at court

<h4>Shoen System</h4>

  * Public Land (owned by the court) and private estates (shoen)
  * Private estates:
      - exempt from taxes
      - immune from inspection
  * privitization of estates
      - enriches bureaucrats
      - reduces influence of the impeirla state

Emperors were not allowed to own private estates. BUT, since a cloistered emperor was not truly the emperor, he was allows to buy land like any other noble. Used this to accumulate wealth and power for the imperial family.

<h4>Reasons for the power of Cloistered Emperors</h4>

  * Cloistered emperors decide on his successor (a young son) and consolidate the position of his successor
  * consolidate power
  * accumulate wealth under the shoen system

<h4>Consequences</h4>

  * Succession wars and wars between cloistered emperors and emperors
  * 1156 - Warriors involved in court disputes
  * 1160-1185 - Head of warrior clan Taira Kiyomori becomes main power at court

      - 1281 Second Mongol invasion

<h4>Origin of the warrior class</h4>

  * Heian Period:
      - Provincial governors are appointed by the imperial court to oversee land
      - they delegated to local lords
      - local lords began to group together to control peasants and protect land. Warrior class: high-ranking peasants, low ranking gentry

     Warrior's spirit: isshokenmei - risking one's life to protect one's land
     
  * Heian Period
      - Imperial Princed placed outside imperial family and given surnames (genji, taira) were moved to provinces and given command of warrior groups to suppress rebellions against the court
  * warriors came to intervene in the dispute at court
  * some rebelled against the court

<h4>Kamakura Period</h4>

  * Cloistered emperor lost power
  * Rise of Warrior Class
  * System of Dual Government
      - Two Courts: Kyoto and Kamakura
  * Kamakura controls provinces, mainly eastern japan
      - shogunate appointed
          + military governors to protect land and keep peace
          + steward to administer land and collect taxes/rent
  * mongol invasion
      - first invasion allowed Kamakura to extend influence into western japan
      - second invasion weakened Kamakura power (couldn't provide rewards for the warriors, bc there are no spoils for a defensive war).

Mongol empire was mass at the time (13th century)

<h4>Estate System</h4>

  * Example of the dual government
  * Shoen system:  
      - lands were donated to patrons of the court
  * imperial court appointed
      - provincial governors to oversee state estates in the provinces
  * Kamakura shogunate appointed

<h4>Relationship bt Kamakura Shogunate and Warriors</h4>

  * Warriors serve the Shogunate
  * it offers 
      - land
      - right to rule said land
      - appointments as
          + military governors (shugo)
          + steward (jito)

At this time, the imperial court and the Shogunate (bakufu) coexist. Why do the shogunate not get rid of the imperial court?

One possible answer:

Kamakura shogunate relies on imperial prestige (authority) to justify rule
