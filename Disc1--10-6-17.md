<h3>Debugger</h3>

Why?
<ul><li>Everybody makes mistakes when coding.</li></ul>

What can it do?
<ul><li>It runs step by step to check for errors</li><li>You can check variable values at any step in the program</li><li>See the call stack (which function you are currently in)</li><li>It also has more advanced features</li></ul>

----

**Examples:**
<ul><li>Quadratic Equation Solver</li></ul>

----

**Visual Studio Instructions:**
>Start Debugging: F5
><ul><li>Pauses at breakpoints</li><li>Console window disappears as soon as the program finishes</li></ul>
>
>Start Without Debugging: Ctrl + F5
><ul><li>Run to the end without stopping</li></ul>
>
>More about Break points:

><ul><li>Pause the program to examine variables and stacks</li><li>set at least one before you start running the debugger</li><li>You can set more as you run the debugger over time</li></ul>
----
``` c++
    #include <iostream>

    int myFunction(){



    }

    int main() {

        int a = myFunction();  //add a breakpoint here to check the values BEFORE the line begins
    }
```

---

Instructions for debugging:

>F5: continue to the next breakpoint
>F10 (step over): Execute a line of code (if this line calls a function, it will execute, but its values will not be shown)
>F11 (step in): Execute a line of code (if th ilne of code calls a finction, it will go in that function and pause at the beginning of that function.)

>Shift > F11: step out

You can examine variable values by hovering over them during a pause.

Tips: Don't put too much code into a single function: this makes it _very_ difficult to debug.

If you feel that a function is getting too long, split it up into smaller functions.

Also,

>>_Google is your friend._
