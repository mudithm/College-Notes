<h1>Lecture 9</h1>

Some Examples:

    void polarToCartesian(double rho, double theta, double& xx, double& yy){
        xx = rho * cos(theta);
        yy = rho * sin(theta);

    }

In the above example, rho and theta are passed-by-value, meaning that their value is delivered to the function but they are immutable by the function. This is the typical way values are used by functions, and is used when the values of the arguments should not be changed.

xx and yy, however, are passed in a manner called "pass by reference." This means that their values are available to the function, and that the function can change their values. Passing by reference is something that you do only if you want to change the value of the arguments.

    void exchange(int& x, int& y);


    int main(){
        ...
        int a;
        int b;

        cin >> a >> b;

        if (a < b)
            exchange(a, b);

        cout << a << " is at least as big as " << b << endl;
    }

    void exchange(int& x, int& y){
        int t;
        t = x;
        x = y;
        y = t;
    }

the functions in the cctype library work on chars, not on string. If you want to act on a string, you must act on each char individually or use a different library.

    ...
    string s = "Hello";
    tolower(s); // This will not work, since s is a string and not a char
    tolower(s[0]); // This compiles, but it is useless since it is not assigned to anything.

    // An effective use of the tolower() function;
    s[0] = tolower(s[0]);

Predicate -- a function that doesn';'t modify anything, but returns a bool

Examples:
    
    if (isValidPhoneNumber(phone))
        /* do something */;
    if (isDigit(ch))
        /* do something */;
    if (hasCorrectSyntax(str))
        /* do something */;
    
    // etc


    string phoneNumber;

    do {
        cout << "Enter a phone number  ";
        getline(cin, phoneNumber);
        
    } 
    while( ! isValidPhoneNumber(phoneNumber));


    ...
    ...
    
    // A better way...

    string phoneNumber;

    while (true){
        cout << "Enter a phone number:  ";
        getline(cin, phoneNumber);
        if (! isValidPhoneNumber(phoneNumber))
            break;
        cout << "Please enter a valid phone number with 10 characters." << endl;
    }

or:

string phoneNumber;

    for (;;){
        cout << "Enter a phone number:  ";
        getline(cin, phoneNumber);
        if (! isValidPhoneNumber(phoneNumber))
            break;
        cout << "Please enter a valid phone number with 10 characters." << endl;
    }


> The `break;` statement breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch.

This structure is called a "n-and-a-half-times-loop"

Another Cool Thing:

    for (...;...;...){
        ...
        if (){

            // short thing
            
            continue;
        }

        ... Rest of iteration ... 
        .........................
        ........................,
    }

> The `continue;` statements signals to the compiler to immediately move to the next iteration, ignoring whatever remains in the current iteration of the loop.

If you assign an int to a char, it will result in the char with that integer representation in the encoding scheme.
