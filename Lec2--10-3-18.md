<h4>The basics, continued...</h4>

  * `man <command>`: gives a detailed desctiption of the syntax and usage of a command
  * hit `q` to go back to the shell
  * `ln`: creates a link 
      - Hard links link to physical data
      - soft links (designated with `-s`) point to a file
  * `touch`: you can also modify a time stamp with the `-t` flag
      - `touch -t <date and time information>`

---

<h5>The Basics: find</h5>

  * `-type`: type of file
  * `perm`: permission of a file
  * `name`: name of a file
  * `user`: owner
  * `maxdepth`: how many levels to search
  * The find command is an extremely thorough and efficient search function 
  * Examples:
      - `find <start path> <flags> <search term>` 
      - `find / -name "file.pdf"` 
      - Symbols: `* ? [a,b,c]` to filter results
          + `find / -name "*.jpg"`: will find any jpeg
          + `find / -name "felix`: will find any file that starts with "felix"
          + More examples can be found [here](https://www.linode.com/docs/tools-reference/tools/find-files-in-linux-using-the-command-line/) and [here](https://www.tecmint.com/35-practical-examples-of-linux-find-command/)
          + `find / -type f <filename>`: searches for file
          + `find / -type d <directory name>`: searches for directory
          + `find / -type f -type d <filename / directory name>`: searches for files and directories

<h5>The Basics: whereis</h5>

  * locate binary, src, and man page files for a command
  * other useful `wh...` commands
  * `whois`, `which`, etc.

---

<h5>man(ual) pages</h5>

  * `man <command>` 
  * first line: command (number)
      - shows what section of the man page you are viewing
  * Man page sections are: (man man)

  1. User Commands
  2. System Calls
  3. Library Functions, etc. Use man man

<h5>Standard headings:</h5>

  * Name: name and short description
  * Synopsis: describes how it is supposed to be used
      - `[Option]`: means this is optional
      -  `[Option]...`: means you can use one or more
  * Description: gives a more detailed definition of syntax and usage, and provides the options available for the command

<h4>Environment Variables</h4>

  * Environment variables are system-wide variables that are available to all programs
  * The most important one is `$PATH`, which contains the directories that contain system commands, etc
  * To see all environment variables, run the command `env`
  * To add a new environment variable or edit one, use the `export` command
      - `export VARNAME="hi"`

<h5>Seeing the values of environment variables</h5>

  * use the `echo` command followed by the variable name to see its value
      - ex: `echo $PATH` will show all the contents of the `PATH` environment variable. Variables in bash are denoted with `$` 
  * To add a directory to the path, do the following 
      - NOTE: Eggert's directory is `/usr/local/cs/bin` 
      - to pre-append this to the path: `export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH` 
  * But, adding to the path using export must be repeated every time you access a terminal/reboot so instead, we edit the login scripts, `.profile` or `.bashrc`
  * So, insert the `export` command inside the `.profile`

---


<h4>Links</h4>

  * Example: `ln <source path> <destination path>` creates a shortcut at the dest to the source
  * There are two types:
      - Hard Links: points directly to the data. The directory entry that is originally created when you make a new file is like a hardlink.
          + Basically creates a copy without using any more space
          + A file will not be deleted unless all of its hard links are deleted. BUT, if you edit it, all hardlinks to the data will point to this edited data
      - Soft Links: points to the directory entry, not the data itself.
          + Acting on a soft link will only affect the link, not the original data. 
          + moving the original document will result in an error if you try to follow the soft link.
          + Kind of like a Windows shortcut
          + Specified by the `-s` flag

<h4>Processes</h4>

  * Process: instance of a program in execution
  * `ps`: lists all active processes
  * `kill`: terminate a certain process
      - use the `pid`, `kill <pid>` 

<h6>Dameon:</h6>

  * A process that constantly runs in the background

---

<h4>Standard Streams</h4>

  * Every program has 3 streams to interact with "the world"
      - `stdin(0)`: Input stream, contains data going to a program 
      - `stdout(1)`: Output stream, where a program writes its output data
      - `stderr(2)`: Error stream, where a program writes its error messages

<h5>Redirection and Pipelines</h5>

  * `program <file` redirects file to programs stdin
      - `cat <file` 
  * `progam > file` redirects program's stdout to a file
      - `cat <file >file2` 
  * `program 2>file` redirects program's stderr to a file
      - `cat <file 2>file2` 
  * `program >> file` append program's stdout to file
  * `program1 | program2` assigns stdout of program1 as the stdin of program2; text flows through the pipeline
      - `cat <file | sort >file2`: sorts the content of file and puts it into file2
